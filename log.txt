I only heard about it recently; a cave with an overflow of enemies, infinite from what some would say. The cave itself is tiny in size, yet there is an abundance of bullet fodder. Traveling takes some time and the journey is perilous. Captains, Vandals, a wizard, knight and Thralls that could very well number into the 1000s stand in your way; yet it is worth the trek. Also finally realizing that you can run past all of them makes it far easier. Being the first to arrive. Will others come? Perhaps. Only time will tell. Fellow guardians finally begin to show. 1, then 2,3,4, and finally the fifth. You all take your place, eyes fixated down the sights at a black hole that houses an unknown amount of evil.

They appear. Guardians gunning them down before they can even make an exit. It is a tight and small entrance and bottlenecks them. It will be their undoing. After an hour or two, the cave glistening with the soft glow of green and blue lights. All those engrams. Yet in the darkness three yellowish eyes appear. They are coming! Bullets find there marks at the felling of the enemy. All of the sudden as if magic, a new color orb appears, as if out of thin air. It is brighter and some how more radiant than the others, a deep purple that some how glows with an iridescent intensity. Running with a burning desire to get to that cave so as not to lose sight of it. To release it from that dark prison. Deleting other filthy greens or blues to make room. A Legendary Helmet Engram it says. What could it be hiding? Going to orbit and to the tower as quickly as possible, hoping to get the best luck. Walking to Rahool; him smiling, and kindly speaking, 

"What do you have for me today guardian?"

"Ohh, do I have something for you! Just wait 'til you see this!"

"Ohh, this looks interesting!" He replies.

I hand it over. Hands shaking. What could it be. A new legendary helm. Maybe it'll be mask of the third man or even Achlyophage Symbiote. Yea that's what it'll be I can feel it.

"Mhmm..." Master Rahool says with intrigue.

He found it I knew it. I knew it! What a guy what a pal. I'm going to buy him a drink after this. He will be my first born son's godpare....

"Here you go." He claims with excitement.

"What the F is this shit?"

He looks confused.

"A Sinaa Jaguar 2.1? WTF is this? An uncommon helm I could buy from the vanguard rep. How could you do this to me. Your friend, your pal...."

"Until next time Guardian!" coldly cutting me off just like he cut out my heart. His eyes lifeless. Heart blackened. Soul empty. 

He is no friend; he is thine enemy. He is the rat on the inside playing his mind games on us. This is the start of a bitter hatred among enemies. He is my nemesis. I will bath in his blood if the time comes. Watch your back Mister Rahool. Don't let me catch you in a dark alleyway or corner in the tower.

But no, Saladman is old and mean to Titan, he say, "git gud," and "Titan can go stand in sunspot if cold," but sunspot only warm for small time so me Titan am sad again.
     I guess big mouth funny hunter man in tower heard Titan was sad one day because he tell Titan he know secret about where Titan can get big blanket, he give Titan secret spy decoder ring and secret message to unlock but then Titan find out secret is just crappy ovaltine commercial, so me Titan am sad again.
     Me Titan not just want blanket for free even, can do many things for friends like make strong bubbles or punch big scary things like shanks. Titan can even do quest for blanket, even if death reset titan progress like quest for stupid poison gun where Titan had nothing but blue boomstick to complete quest. Titan is strong with big head and can complete many quest for blanket.

Screwed up horrendouslu
Ok fuck you auto correct
Accurate
im the libertarian right lmao
So I just filled Collins channel with porn.
Here\xe2\x80\x99s a sneak peek
proudly pointless?
Yep
how am i supposed to get off to that?
I filled it with food porn because I started a pole to see what people wanted and a hand full of people said porn.
thats......*sigh* thats not what we meant
we mean that prenium meat beating material
Oh ok
XD
He\xe2\x80\x99s a helicopter, he can\xe2\x80\x99t get off to food because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need it like we do
*ahem* I am now fully in favor of the revert back to Title 1 regulation and giving the FTC control of internet regulation once again
FTC Privacy Regulation, sec.177\xc2\xa0\n\nRestoring FTC jurisdiction over ISPs will enable the FTC to apply its extensive privacy and data security expertise to provide the uniform online privacy protections that consumers expect and deserve.651\nAka, websites will have a much more difficult time selling your data.\n\nFCC release, p.83\n\nMany of the largest ISPs (Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, Cox, Frontier, etc.) have committed in this proceeding not to block or throttle legal content.507\xc2\xa0These\xc2\xa0commitments can be enforced\xc2\xa0by the FTC under Section 5, protecting consumers without imposing public-utility regulation on ISPs.508\n\nFCC release p.82\n\nThe FTC\xe2\x80\x99s unfair-and-deceptive-practices authority \xe2\x80\x9cprohibits companies from selling consumers one product or service but providing them something different,\xe2\x80\x9d which makes voluntary commitments enforceable.502\xc2\xa0The FTC also requires the \xe2\x80\x9cdisclos[ur]e [of] material information if not disclosing it would mislead the consumer,\xe2\x80\x9d so if an ISP \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to disclose blocking, throttling, or other practices that would matter to a reasonable consumer, the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s deception authority would apply.\xe2\x80\x9d503\n\n\nFCC invokes Sherman Act Antitrust Laws, Section 144, p.85, FCC release\n\nSection 1 of the Sherman Act bars contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, making anticompetitive arrangements illegal. If ISPs reached agreements to unfairly block, throttle, or discriminate against Internet conduct or applications, these agreements would be per seillegal under the antitrust laws.518\n\n\nAnd additionally\n\nIf an ISP that also sells video services degrades the speed or quality of competing \xe2\x80\x9cOver the Top\xe2\x80\x9d video services (such as Netflix),526\xc2\xa0that conduct could be challenged as anticompetitive foreclosure.
FCC repeatedly acknowledges that its new policy is deliberately business-friendly in hopes to expand the economy (internet plays a huge role obviously). Acknowledges that potential abuse of this friendliness will result in stricter policy.
Krabs is me
What about me ;-;
Why the fuck can a recorder get so damn high?
It goes higher
That\xe2\x80\x99s the highest this fingering chat goes.
I am officially the highest person here
\xf0\x9f\x98\x98\xf0\x9f\x91\x8c\xf0\x9f\x94\xa5\xf0\x9f\x94\xa5\xf0\x9f\x94\xa5
Why does the one comfortable seat in the basement have to be in the corner where there is no internet?
I get two bars if I scoot a foot to the left but right here I get nothing.
Is everyone dead? None of my chats are active

When was that a thing?
Years ago on YouTube
oh ok
When the Finebros where relevant, that long ago
Unless you want to scar yourself, don\xe2\x80\x99t watch it

2014?
Around that
The fine bros stoped being relevant when they tried to get the rights to the word \xe2\x80\x9creact\xe2\x80\x9d
~early 2016
Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact they sucked before and after that
In my eyes,Shrek is love Shrek is life was the spiritual successor to this
That\xe2\x80\x99s ur opinion
React stuff wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really my thing so
A popular one at most
I was only nine years old
Their continued subscribers and videos begs to differ
I loved Shrek so much, I had all the merchandise and movies
They lost a million subs
But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make ur opinion popular
A million people now a days ain\xe2\x80\x99t nothing
Shrek is life
I\xe2\x80\x99m not arguing why my opinion is valid, this would be the stupidest thing to argue over
My dad hears me and calls me a faggot
I call him a cunt
He slaps me and sends me to my room
I\xe2\x80\x99m not either I\xe2\x80\x99m saying why ur statement \xe2\x80\x9ca popular one\xe2\x80\x9d is wrong
I forget how the rest goed
I forget how the rest goes
Something something onions
I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the, personally, they are sellouts
Something my but tearing
I don\xe2\x80\x99t like them personally, they are sellouts
Something my butt tearing
I love when the teacher has to have a talk about not failing English 11 A and how he had to round up peoples 20-30% to 50% because its required for the first 9 weeks.

Well sir
You could rather say \xe2\x80\x9cat most my opinion is widely accepted\xe2\x80\x9d \nThis statement doesn\xe2\x80\x99t imply it\xe2\x80\x99s a popular one, just a pretty big one
It\xe2\x80\x99s just a theory
A game theory

Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me started on attack of the clones
Hey now that movie was okay
Except for the \xe2\x80\x9clove\xe2\x80\x9d between anakin and paddle
Except for the \xe2\x80\x9clove\xe2\x80\x9d between anakin and padme
I mean the Geinosis arena screen was cool
Their love story was like anakin loving a chair
Kinky
The whole end of the movie was cool
That would be a better story
It was very well done the end of the movie
The beginning \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigation\xe2\x80\x9d was also cool
Every time they cut to anakin and padme I mentally say \xe2\x80\x9cgo back to obi wan\xe2\x80\x9d
The part where they introduce the clones, and that story is taken farther in the Clone wars was pretty good
Every single time
Attack of the clone\xe2\x80\x99s downfall was the love story
Everything else was not a bad movie at all
Great plot, not a whole lot of holes but every movie has plot holes
The love story kinda got in the way \n\nIf they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have that love story as a focus and had it more of a under tone, it would have been received better
But it\xe2\x80\x99s like in your face like a bad case of hives
Yup
It slowed the plot down too much
They remind us they are in love, yea great, but this is Star Wars, not twilight
The love story is the only thing I can see wrong about that movie, all the other complaints people has made about it really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect how good the movie is
I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched and read many things that elaborated why it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad movie
The love story is basically the only thing that ruined the movie
I came here to watch Jedi and fighting not anakin trying to fuck a chair
Hayden christen did a great job as anakin
Oh yea he done a great job
You could really see what anakin was going through
WOW
WOOOOOOO
FOOTBALL
I HAVENT HAD ONE OF THESE IN MONTHS
IM SHAKING A BIT
MAYBE THATS BECAUSE ITS COLD THO
Sugar high, you shake
I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a sugar high
I DONT GET SHUGAR HIGHS
I NEVER HAVE
The Death of Anakins mother was kinda forced and if you have a brain, you could seen that coming sende the Phantoms Menace
UR SUGR HI
The Death of Anakins mother was kinda forced and if you have a brain, you could seen that coming sense the Phantoms Menace
Ur body has too much sugar.  Too much energy so ur muscles are twitching
It was so cliched
Well not entirely
Most of the time that\xe2\x80\x99s the end of that characher, never killed but just forgotten
Well yea and it does give Anakin that dark side boost
It was similar to luke in a new hope
Lost his aunt and uncle
Bitcoin is about to break 10k
Yea
You do realize they are practically script parallels
The difference was how they took it
Yea
Anakin took it as him being too weak, luke figured the same thing but didn\xe2\x80\x99t seek revenge, unlike anakin
Luke kinda brushed it off in my eyes, but Anakin was Pissed
That too
Luke decided that he needed to learn how to use the force, not for revenge but now he really needed too, he now doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything left on Tatooine
Let go of your feelings, that was Luke being Jedi before a Jedi
Yeah
In his Aunts and uncles case
Luke knew it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t his fault, their wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything he could do
Anakin didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that and got mad
Luke kinda got mad on the spot in Ben or Obi\xe2\x80\x99s case, but learned that that\xe2\x80\x99s what he wanted
When he sacrificed himself so he could leave
He was raised to move on, he lived on farm on a desert planet.  If you don\xe2\x80\x99t move on you die
Basically
Exactly
When he sacrificed himself so he could leave, that part
Exact

Labor force participation down, student loans up. Looks like everyone lost their job and went back to school
too bad school prices are fucking ridiculous
They should have thought about that before wasting their money the first time
Those are more likely people that went to school when it was cheap as fuck
Also looks like people sold their homes or lost them

@Danny_Dan4 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to have a Skyrim character who never kills anyone. What skills should I work on and what quest lines do you think would work?
Idk lol
You kill one way or the other in basically all quests
Try not playing skyrim
Yup
You can be at least a moderate killer
At the very least
Skyrim is not a place for pacifists
Why do the main story? It\xe2\x80\x99s boring. I wanna see if I can get my speech to lvl 100
Speech and sneak at 100 at least
Then why do imperials have a power to calm all surrounding enemies and why do calm spells exist?
I want to try to be a traveling merchant
So you can kill them without resistance
Or steal money
Shooting fish in a barrel
You close minded
Me?
No Alex and Sean
No they\xe2\x80\x99re just blood thirsty teens
BULL
No sh
You can choose to do the quests and shit
Or not
Do not insult our lord and savior Minecraft with such an insult like that
I knowww
You can do ANYTHING
Nothing can come close to the amazingness of Minecraft 1.0
No seriously 95% of the quests are killing something someway or the other
Io
Ik*
Minecraft has those too
Ehhhh.  Minecraft modpacks from 1.4.7
Those were the BEST
Like kill the ender dragon
Or shoot a skelly 50 ft away
1.4.7 and 1.6.4 were the BEST for mods

That was so long ago, in a similar time
I got Minecraft on a deal for 25% off
I got it on a Halloween iirc
I got it full price as a gift from my mom
They just added something and had a Halloween sale
Yeah I did too, so it must have been in 2011
Not on sale.
Oh yeah that hoopsters account
Yep
I still have that on a drawing pad in ur handwriting
U wrote it down so I would remember when we went on a server
Galaxy or whatever
I remember back in fifth grade when my friends James, grace, and chris all used to play Minecraft together and talk about it at lunch and I had never seen it before so I was left to my imagination to try to imagine what they were talking about and damn it sounded so cool till I learned it was all made of blocks.
XD
Imagine 5th grade me trying to picture a tnt cannon for the first time
Galaxycraft
That made it better for me, It was like building with legos
I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see this
I pictured something like this
Lol
Just more rounded and smaller
Like a cannon
But bigger
Then they told me about the nether... I got sent to the principals office for drawing what they described because the teacher found it too inappropriate to be drawing hell like images.
My mom ordered me an Iron Cross ring sense we skipped out on Class rings this year

Yes
I know that

Planning 20 for alpha
I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s bad or not, but my guess is that\xe2\x80\x99s a bother
So you\xe2\x80\x99re almost finished the weapons if I\xe2\x80\x99m reading this right
I\xe2\x80\x99m not used to Minecraft coding shit, I only know how to make my own sticker pack
We have 400 weapons and armor for the warrior class going up to level 20
XD
So 20 is the level cap
Currently.
Wait no
Not yet
60 will be for release
I see
But alpha is 20
Or, at least, the beginning of alpha
Or did you not plan that far yet?
Oo okay
We have a roadmap for alpha yes
Yea as I said, when it comes to coding in Minecraft, I know exactly zero [no pun intended] about it
Either this is out of my element, or this is real simple and I\xe2\x80\x99m being a dumbass
All classes\nBasic guild\nSkills\nBanks\nAuction houses
Along with content
Along with content up to level 60
Oh yeah and an instanced dungeon system
Yep it was the second reason, easy and I\xe2\x80\x99m stupid
During alpha phase 2 we will complete:\nBeta:\nExtended guilds\nFurther PvP (battlegrounds and arenas)\nProfessions
During alpha phase 2 we will complete:\nExtended guilds\nFurther PvP (battlegrounds and arenas)\nProfessions
Then open beta
Then release
We might make "phase 2" open beta
We might make "phase 2" open beta instead

Did it
Person who supports USSR and Stalin and all that
Well not every communist supported Stalin, Yugoslavia left the Warsaw Pact early on

Right. Not every commie is a tankie

Non Americans or American citizens that immigrated
Because that feels like very serious bullshit
Illegals

Definitely source that
Before saying it
Yeah hang on
Multiple sources if possible, but one should suffice in a predicament
We have been.
That are entirely echo chambers.
They are literally the definition of echo chambers.
Look, if they ban people for being in the other side, they are most definitely echo chambers.
You are insanely closed minded.
Anarchists often have different opinions on the importance of gender or racial issues, how trade should work ideally, and any other number of topics\n\nLeftists have differences between democratic socialism, anarchism, Marxism Leninism, Maoism, etc etc etc
Maybe you should put some alt-righters in there to get their opinions too.
Learn a thing or two from the opposing side.
Groups with a more limited scope are necessary for refining beliefs beyond basic disagreements with the status quo. If a group is entirely open then disliking capitalism is as far as you can get through debate- you will never discuss the merits of democratic, authoritarian, or anarchist implementation if you are constantly under attack for the basic principles of anticapitalism
But the thing is: disagreement is healthy.
Have you read mein kampf?
Same, actually
How do you think he won?
But the thing is: have you actually thought about the issues with the basic standpoint?
Like into detail.
Why do you believe what you believe, and is the belief based on a fallacy?
Okay my thing was outdated, and apparently they might be losing jobs XD
I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit I was wrong
...
Immigrants in general
Do you guys wanna make a book club chat
We could read stuff
Hell ya
And talk about it
Like political stuff mostly
I\xe2\x80\x99m down
Oh yeah I gots get that book for Collin
No u up
Would you join a political book club chat?
I would if I had any interest in bookreading
...I smell a hypocrisy
Kidding
I typically read random crap online
You can read most political books online too tho
But books like that tend to either be way too dry, or just too annoying/expensive to obtain
Hmk
Would you join a political book club chat?
Well that kills any chance of me joining.
Stephen might join.
Or Noah
Why not just a book club then make the book a political book
v:
Same thingggg
Not
Hek u
no u
3:<
And are you gonna join
One only allows political books
Yeah if it was a specific genera
Yeah if it was a specific genre
Genre
Mainly political novels
Like mein Kampala
Like mein Kampf
Or the communist manifesto
I think he gets it
From Marx to Hitler, from Rand to Bakunin, we will read them all
@Danny_Dan4 http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/thorium.aspx
THATS A ELEMENT??
Abundantly available nuclear power which is more stable and much cheaper than uranium
Thorium is cool
More stable is a bad thing in nuclear reactors tho tbh
But.., less meltdowns...?
Chernobyl was what happens when you shut off literally every single safety measure, then run a test of said safety measures.
+the power surge
^this
The power surge was actually the test iirc
Either that or it was just a random thing that happens
Who would win, one super protected Nuclear factory, or one streaky boy
Well that big ass blob of pure uranium and lots of metal and glass is a big problem in the long run
Or would be
It takes about an hour standing in that room to kill you
It was about 3 minutes when the disaster first happened tho
Yes, when this thing first started, when they first found it, standing there for about 3 mins can end you
*will.
^
30 seconds could kill, 3 minutes would.
Yea different sources say 30s other say 3 mins
It takes between 30 seconds to 3 minutes to get a lethal dose.
Er, took
Nope.
Well yea, it does t follow a schedule
Just a normal day staying after school
Why
And with gen 4 reactors coming out in 2020, we will even start using the nuclear waste to generate power.
Oh hey Fawcett
So who pressed the button? I wanna get started
Doin good
Are you doing the book club?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqAGF_OOZ0A&feature=youtu.be
Yeah yeah
The soviets were going to keep the Chernobyl thing under wraps, but radiation said \xe2\x80\x9cfuck you\xe2\x80\x9d, and other neighboring countries picked up on it
How long is dog pregnancy
Shit this isn\xe2\x80\x99t google

same
Also I suggest not bringing up politics
I ALSO HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS
yeah same
OH GOD HE BROKE THE UNSPOKEN RULE
It usually creates a massive argument
Very stoned
same
MEIN KAMPF
i agree
This is probably because "the attack on the world trade center" is a bit of a mouthful
Either that, or its just a placeholder name if another attack happens
Like how WWI was called "the great war" before WWII
:v
Do you have me blocked?
Ok
You rang?
I know a shit ton of other battle and shit
Other than those battles
The smaller ones are the interesting ones
Like the battle for Castle Itter
Lol
The best battle ever: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Bucket
Barbosa was what happens when you plan on the spot
Never forgetting the Christmas truce in WW 1
Fun fact: for the first year that a president ever had the nuclear football. The launch code was 12345678
Yep!
9/11 sounds better \n\nPlus, those were named after the cities, or D-Day was named for....umm....
9/11 is catchy
Heck, when the war ended, they called it \xe2\x80\x9cve-day\xe2\x80\x9d
Victory in Europe
Then VJ Day, victory in japan day
OwO
Victory Europe day
VJ Day is victory japan day
It had in, VE and VJ is just shorthand
Victory in Europe \n\nThey just shortened it to VE so Churchill could do the first peace sign
Although he did it cuz \xe2\x80\x9cV for victory\xe2\x80\x9d
Rest is coming tomorrow

For one computer
Why tho
To match the 8 RX 580s
O
Yes
Mining rig
Mining what?
Ethereum v:
And other altcoin
I\xe2\x80\x99m so confused
What?
Crypto
What
... Bitcoin...?
Except not
How does the mining come into play
Hehe
I\xe2\x80\x99ve never understood that
I could explain it for ya
Mining is the process of confirming transactions essentially
O
When a block of transactions is confirmed, the rig that did the confirmation receives some coin
Like khajiit
Hm
Wait what kind of transactions?
$5 a day from one 1080Ti
Wo
Bitcoin transactions
Wow
Expensive rig, though
So it just does that forever?
Hm?
Err until it decides to break
The computer goes non stop
100% of the time mining
Oh
So you just get money by doing jack shit all day
Good to know ur contributing to the economy
Ye
Actually are
The computer helps to secure and legitimize the crypto market
It also keeps it functioning
I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the crypto market is all that big
The Bitcoin market cap is 24 billion I think
1 BTC is worth 10k
Well then
Do you know how much this market actually sends into the economy?
To sell a BTC someone has to but it and vice verda
To sell a BTC someone has to but it and vice versa
To sell a BTC someone has to buy it and vice versa
So if I buy a Bitcoin, someone else is selling it and receiving my money
Okay
My dad invested $200 to start and bought a $2500 mining rig in less than two months
Using money he gained
So yes
Side note: the system is totally 100% decentralized
Bitcoin is not owned by any company or government
BTC broke 10k a little bit ago
I wonder what would happen if it reached its cap
Or would the miners make it higher before it reached that point?
What cap
Oh alright
I thought it meant "once a btc reach 24million $ value it can\
Like, if there are 20 BTC and each one is worth 2 bucks, market cap is $40
Iirc
I would talk to @hitmarksnipsnap about thay
There is a finite amount of BTC
Once the amount is reached, no more is ever created no matter what.
Ever
Unlike a government that can just print more money
What?
The cap on the amount of BTC is different from market cap
Market cap is how much all the BTC in existence ate worth in dollars
The BTC cap is how many can ever be created
Oh, alright that makes more sense
Market cap is how much all the BTC in existence are worth in dollars
Because if you could have an seemingly infinite amount inflation would take over and eventually make it worth nothing
BTC is created when miners confirm a block of transactions
Yes
Currently, this amount is only 12.5 BTC, and drops about every four years. Alongside that are consumer transaction fees which help pay the minets
Currently, this amount is only 12.5 BTC, and drops about every four years. Alongside that are consumer transaction fees which help pay the miners
As long as BTC is used, being a miner is profitable
Currently, this amount is only 12.5 BTC, and halves about every four years. Alongside that are consumer transaction fees which help pay the miners
Giving the miners less?
The transaction fees pay the miners
So it would increase their pay
Yeah that\xe2\x80\x99s not how this works
The government can\xe2\x80\x99t print more money
Governments have
The Federal reserve can
There was a time when our currency was based on how much gold or silver we had
It\xe2\x80\x99s not supposed to
Not anymore
No
But it doesm
But it does.
No
I said there was a time
Well yes
But I decreases the value of all money
Adding more money doesn\xe2\x80\x99t solve anything value wise
Its why gold is worth so much, it\xe2\x80\x99s not abundant
A downside or BTC is if you lose your wallet address, that BTC is gone forever
A piece of grass ain\xe2\x80\x99t worth shit cuz....it\xe2\x80\x99s everywhere
No recovery possible
Damn
A downside of BTC is if you lose your wallet address, that BTC is gone forever
Yeah but that\xe2\x80\x99s not why it was worth so much
Very.  Although it\xe2\x80\x99s not the go to metal to conduct electricity
Its also extremely malleable
Frighteningly so
Then what makes it valueable?
Put it over a fire for a bit, and you can bend it
Rarity
Its not like I can go dig in my backyard and find gold
You can flatten a nugget of gold the size of your thumb nail to the area of a tennis court
Jocks be like: B e T
People went, and ended up losing money because there was no gold for them
The rare few thay got rich got rich but everyone else either went back or settled California
Iirc, you can fit all the gold in circulation in about a 9 foot by 9 foot cube
Proof that California was made by failures
Huh.  I did not know that
I believe the future of currency is a fork or bitcoin
I believe the future of currency is a fork of bitcoin
I don\xe2\x80\x99t think currency should go digital anyways
Makes it easier for the government to control ur money
Yeah but nobody is gonna make a decentralized banking system any time soon
Plus the government probably would find a way
Any form of digital currency will just be centralized
Are we talking about crypto mining?
Bitcoin is literally that system
I mean one for actual currency
:v
All it needs is acceptance
The work is done
Congress would have to accept it tho
Pfft
And I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure they made their stance on that
Well mostly
No legally
They can prevent businesses from accepting it
Legally speaking bitcoin isn\xe2\x80\x99t a legit currency that can be used in trade and shit
Letting bitcoin be used in this day in age is a bad idea
I agree
Why so?
The economy is gonna die again here soon and that woild probs cause worse issues
The housing bubble is back
Literally nobody learned from 2008
Banks are doing EXACTLY Whag they did before and the government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything to regulate banks that \xe2\x80\x9care too big to fail\xe2\x80\x9d yet they fail
And what would back the Bitcoins up?
Their trade value?
Yea
(The dollar is based on our governments ability to tax which isn\xe2\x80\x99t how this works)
Well yes
They wish it was
No. It IS
No it ain\xe2\x80\x99t
The major big oil countries use the dollar as their currency of choice
It is the only reason it has value
That\xe2\x80\x99s because the biggest ones we invaded
So what
They still use it
Our currency is dependent on the oil industry
Instead of it being based on the gold standard, we are essentially on the oil standard
And it\xe2\x80\x99s backed by gold, but gold is the total amount of money one country has if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken
Not anymore
No.
Fort Knox is empty
Not since the 40s
Not sense the 50\xe2\x80\x99s
Yea that\xe2\x80\x99s what I figured
Whatever
Fort Knox is empty
Still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t dismiss the hyper specific price of gold
Britain made a good call by backing their currency with silver
And "too big to fail" doesn\
Oh yea
It means they are literally too big for us to let them go out of business
No that\xe2\x80\x99s just their excuse to not do anything
We need to give them money
Essentially
That\xe2\x80\x99s bullshit
Very
The deregulation of the early 2000\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to happen
The banks were fine how they were
They were mega corporations that have money comeing our their asses
Ya know money from the feds sometimes if I recall
Need more money, print some up
The Federal reserve is terrible
They are mega corporations that have money comeing our their asses
Horrible
Remember when we were kids and we thought $1 was a lot of money
It\xe2\x80\x99s the worst idea in the long sad history of bad ideas
That didn\xe2\x80\x99t work well with the Germans though, they needed stuff to base it off of, but that was decades ago
Yeah, Hitler\xe2\x80\x99s plan to fix that worked and it\xe2\x80\x99s amazing apparently
Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget the debt thing, they solve thay by raising the debt ceiling
Oh definitely
Most of the US debt is with itself
Oh hell ya
I\xe2\x80\x99m convinced that the current government in power has no idea what the hell its doing
We are billions in the hole last time i checked
19 trillion I think
More than 20 trillion
20.7 trillion
Seriously we broke 20?
Yes
Well now we have a problem
Damn I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that
The deregulation thing is actually really needed, imo
http://www.usdebtclock.org
We should astroid mine, there\xe2\x80\x99s a NEO that is worth 20 trillion dollars in platinum or something
Palladium? Platinum?  I\xe2\x80\x99d have to check
I think Space X is planning to do that
Well apparently the debt rate went down a lot since the inauguration
Its still going up
They plan a lot
But much slower
Hey the deficit is going down
We aren\xe2\x80\x99t spending as much I gues
Yes
Yes
Brb dinner
But that\xe2\x80\x99s like around 20 or 30 years from now they\xe2\x80\x99ll do it
The previous administration learned nothing from school except addition
Have fun

TIL it is illegal under German law to deny the holocaust, which is punishable by up to 5 years in prison. [Source]
I love watching a live feed of our debt going up by thousands of dollars every minute
I knew this, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you could get that long of a sentence
Same, a year ago it would have been tens of thousands a second
Just cut fucking spending
Well most of it was the recession
They had a problem before that.
A $9 trillion problem
Personally I think only a businessman can figure out how to fix this shit, hence trump
Anything debt problem, but that\xe2\x80\x99s just ridiculous
Thats why I oppose anyone who thinks the us can become a welfare state
Exactly, he knows a shit ton about business, he the perfect man for this
Not in the slightest
Can we really afford anything?
Wait
No!
It\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of if we care enough
Heres an idea! Stop paying for illegals food stamps!
If US dollars are worth more then some other nations currency does that mean they\xe2\x80\x99re more in debt then we are?
We would if we put punishments for exporting jobs
No
Yes
No more of this "oh we couldn\
Painfully true
Money is king remember?
If dollar signs aren\xe2\x80\x99t involved, the government could give lesser of a damn
The sooner they start educating useful stuff to kids the better their employees which equals better profit
Start then young and teach them right. Don\xe2\x80\x99t teach a music prodigy calculus
I think instead of the slogan: make america great again. It should be: make america give a shit again.
Back to the topic of us being in debt, we owe a lot of countries a lot money, like Russia, what if they were to demand the money we owe them, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have it, and we are 100% fucked
You said it best
As much as I would love to continue bitching about our fucked up economy, I have to get sleep, goodnight every one
I know McDonalds is a big food chain but it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary
Goodnight
Same goodnight
Wait is everyone leaving? ;-; you guys were the only thing giving me motivation to do my homework
Got a fedora today
Well I can stay here a little longer, if I spot saying stuff, I fell asleep
Fine, my mom just forces me to go to my room I can continue chatting
Looks like an ice cream cone
you have a special os, said os will max out all cards
Well I can stay here a little longer, if I stop saying stuff, I fell asleep
Okay that looks better, just the angle the picture was taken

Plz no, my sides
If you want cheap food make it at home don\xe2\x80\x99t be a lazy unhealthy bum
The only thing tolerable to eat there is the fries
Even then I\xe2\x80\x99d rather go to Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s

Oh wait nope it\xe2\x80\x99s always out when I go
Lol even that tastes like shit
Yep because it\xe2\x80\x99s always hooked up to another drinks thing
Snap
Snap
Oh we know that, it\xe2\x80\x99s a shit show
I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure they use scrap meats that are left over after the expensive good stuff is take.
School meals tastes better than... what ever McDonalds feeds us
My favorite restaurant is subway tbh
Their cookies too
If they put the exact smell of subway into a candle, I would buy that shit up
The food isnt the best, but the atmosphere more than makes up for it.
I always order the meatball and or pizza subs
And the people who work there at any of them are really nice
That\xe2\x80\x99s an achievement all on its own
I can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to find it but I\xe2\x80\x99ll look harder, there\xe2\x80\x99s a video you guys should watch
Fuck now I\xe2\x80\x99m \xf0\x9f\x87\xad\xf0\x9f\x87\xba

I seen that a while ago and it\xe2\x80\x99s the best thing ever
This really shows you how stupid we are
I remember watching this in health class at my old school, and your statement exactly
Like in 6th grade
My upstairs neighbors are playing mariachi music
Do you own a recorder?
Call in a complaint
When my neighbors dick head of s dog barks it\xe2\x80\x99s usual 7 hours, and the play their painful dubstep that literally shakes my Windows\xe2\x80\x99s, my mom calls the office,
If so I want you to half way cover the thumb hole, then do one finger on the top index finger hole and then cover the forth and fifth hole with you right index and right middle finger and blow hard fast air into it. That will be a 8th octave C on piano. Normal middle C around where most music is written is 4 octaves below that.
When my neighbors dick head of a dog barks it\xe2\x80\x99s usual 7 hours, and they play their painful dubstep that literally shakes my Windows\xe2\x80\x99s, my mom calls the office,
I know how to be annoying if I need to be.
I usually just throw stuff at my ceiling and usually they stop
Because the floor is thin and it amplifies that noise and it scares them
Ooooo
Sounds fun
Listen to Dig Down For What by Lemmy Lemsters #np on #SoundCloud\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lemmy-koopa-2/dig-down-for-what
I have a room full of instruments so if people in my house wanna be loud I will be loud too.
My brother thinks 9:30 is a good time to practice baritone, I think 9:30 is a great time to practice the upper register of a recorder.
No matter how loud he plays the recorder will cut right through it and kill his ears from across the house
I liked it when I had Muslim upstairs neighbors because the only time I could here them was when the were doing their prayers.
I love music science
Full band full of brass players all playing super loud vs. one out of tune piccolo = bleeding ears.

*Dives out the closet window, breaks neck on the pavement*
So I get out of the shower and recognize the movie playing on the tv downstairs. Of corse the night after I finally found an illegal copy of The Kingsmen golden circle my dad decides to buy it on our Apple TV.

I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind
Alexander.boyd right

Yeet
Is it worth it to get an Xbox one s or should I save money and just get the Xbox one
How about neither
Get a switch or a ps4
Ignore "55 words" "first lines *whatever it says*" and "YOI"  the other ones I\
Build a pc then
But I want to play overwatch with my friends
And they use xbox
Kay
But is the one s worth the extra $80-100
Oops
Idk, I play PC and Nintendo
The one X is the only worthwhile xbox.
Hahahahaha
Currently, that is.
Guys
I might be getting my piano tuned finally
Cool
Nice
The one S has 75% of the ram as the one X does but is 50% the price
But
And backwards compatibility
They both have backwards compatibility
It might, but their hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been any new titles that might be exclusive that look interesting to me
According to the Microsoft website the games that are exclusive to it are enhanced versions of games on the one s

Microsoft did something right?
Yes, the xbone X is the one modern case where the console is close enough hardware-wise to win out performance wise due to constant hardware.
My is old and only does 1080p

My tv is old and only does 1080p
Oop
At 4K the PC does worse due to VRAM limitations, but at 1080p, you can actually hit ultra settings at 60 fps.

On a $500 PC.
That you can actually upgrade later for a fraction of the cost.
The PS4 pro is sort of an ok choice?
The real winner here is the iPhone 9, it was so full of raw energy and uncontrollable power that they can\xe2\x80\x99t release it yet because the world wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to handle it.

turk:\n\nThe cheapest way to win at Age of Empires II: The Conquers. Their special unit is the Janissary which a crazy powerful gunpowder unit that kicks too much ass to be fair. If a player has 15 of these fuckers lined up in a row they are almost impossible to beat. Not to mention the Turks have a great cavalry and defense advantages over all other civilizations. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a hint if your opponent launches a bunch of Janissary units at you, your best bet is to use a row of Onagers or Siege Onagers and fucking let them know that their a cheap bastard.\n\nSteve: How did Tim win that last game of Age of Empires?\nBill: That fucker used the Turks.\nSteve: Wow what a cheap douche bag.

Something amazing just happened
Did you do a flip?
So there are these kids on my brother\xe2\x80\x99s bus that pick on him and mess with him. My brother has autism, so he can\xe2\x80\x99t do things fast enough to defend himself. I tell these kids to fuck off, but you know the little dweebs won\xe2\x80\x99t listen. So today getting off the bus, on of them pushes my brother. I\xe2\x80\x99m running over there to kid the living shit out of him. But my brother gets up, looks at this kid dead in the eyes, my brother thrusts back, and punches him straight in the face
I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t breath I was laughing to hard
So the kid and his group of delinquents run and I\xe2\x80\x99m just praising my brother, telling him good job, patting him on the back
It was just precious
Tell him a large flannel-adoring man says "good job kiddo"

Ten years of Steam purchases: An answer to "are PC games cheaper than console games?"\nI was in my steam account page today and came across a summary of my total purchases:http://ift.tt/2kdxIWI(7297.69 DH is equivalent to $1986.87)I was shocked by how high the amount was. If PC gaming is cheaper, how could I have spent nearly two thousand dollars!I checked purchase history and confirmed that yep, every amount in that total was from credit card purchases, not including free/humble bundle keys the way aggregate sites outside steam calculate it.and yes, the purchase history reflected when I purchased games on a steam saleAs the shock settled on me I got to thinking. I purchased from the steam store over a period of ten years.If I was a console peas.. gamer and I purchased games at full price from the mall, how much would $1986.87 stretch to?$1986.87 / $60 = approx. 33 games33 games!!

Awwww
fuck off
432 games for the price of 99
actually fuck off
You had to be there, as soon as my brother went down, all I saw was red and I B-lined for the little shit, but the funny part was, when my brother looked at him, he ask my brother \xe2\x80\x9cwhat you going to do about it?\xe2\x80\x9d
Heh heh

TL;DR this guy got 432 PC games for the price of 99 used console games or 33 new games
TIL during the exceptionally cold winter of 1795, a French Hussar regiment captured the Dutch fleet on the frozen Zuiderzee, a bay to the northwest of the Netherlands. The French seized 14 warships and 850 guns. This is one of the only times in recorded history where calvary has captured a fleet. [Source]

fuck off
cunt
My brother doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have full autism, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to get to know him to fully understand
You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t notice from afar
None the less, he should still be recognized for standing up to a bully like that
Oh hell yea
I am so fucking proud of him
In the school system, he would get noticed. By getting punished for it.
Oh he won\xe2\x80\x99t
He didn\xe2\x80\x99t get in troublelast time he stood up
Plus it happened at home, not school
The school has no jurisdiction
Oh shit
does it matter tho
the topic is pointless
like I get the fact you wanna fucking poke him with this god damn topic by shoving your point down his throat, but you seriously should just let it slide
Hey could you do me a quick favor?
Hm
be genuinely happy
It looks like a bulleted list
I mean I hate myself and all but damn.

Wow
Nah
Plus he was gonna make you a communist, i want my daughter to be full American
CPUSA
Unamerican Party
I prefer the libertarian party
But it has America in the name so it must be American \xf0\x9f\xa4\x94\xf0\x9f\xa4\x94\xf0\x9f\xa4\x94\xf0\x9f\xa4\x94
Me too
South America\nNorth America\nCentral America \nAmerican somoa\n\nWait...
It has USA in the name :p
Is what I meant
We took the American title.
At one point, that was a controversial thing.
Tbh
In the 20th century the American identity became more unique to this country
Everyone should call us the States I mean
South Americans during the 20th century built their own identities
I would like that
"Going to America" would be like going to Europe
They do.  But we the United States\n\nWait no, Europeans call us America
Mhm
Brits call us the States
And America
I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched enough yoga cast to know this
Yoga cast
Even Canadians call us America
YOGA TIME
I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched enough yogscast to know this
DOWNWARD DOGE
I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind being call an American
Canadians better
They don\xe2\x80\x99t have an identity anyways
They basically Americans
A N G E R Y
CANADAS NATIONAL IDENTITY IS UNDER ATTACK
The word \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican\xe2\x80\x9d has been associated with our country and nobody cares
BY INVADING AMERICANS
WHEN SHE GETS THAT LAND, WAR WILL BEGIN!!!
Mexicans like being called Mexicans \n\nBrazilians like being Brazilians \n\nSo I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fine
BY INVADING STATERS
Lmao
Not anymore
Like how Italians are Italians but also Europeans
Yeah but we\xe2\x80\x99ve created the American identity
Europe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have that
They prefer being called by where they came from
Italians don\xe2\x80\x99t like being called European, they are Italian
My grandparents don\xe2\x80\x99t ever say they are from Europe, they say Italy
They were born in Italy
K
Even those islands if possible
What?
Just cause of the river and weird divides
I just want the rest of that library
If we get that, they should get alaaka
we won\xe2\x80\x99t give that up
Our Chinese teacher has ideas about border there
It\xe2\x80\x99s oil rich we ain\xe2\x80\x99t giving it up
https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-us-canada-border-runs-through-this-tiny-library.amp
NOOOO NOT SNOW TEXAS
I remember reading about this last year
I think the Maine border should be cleaned up, the large border should also be cleaned up a bit, little bits that just need to be put on the 35th parallel where they belong
The Alaskan border looks fine tbh
Now, the best way to fix it, would be to annex Canada
But
The flag...
Butt
It would get even worse
I said the best way
We would add......6 new stars
(??)
How many provinces are there in Canada?
10
So 60 states
\xf0\x9f\x85\xb1\xef\xb8\x8foi google
Should just shoot for 12, get cube and pr
Cuba... not cube
60 states good lord
We could have annnexed Cuba at one point
But Was afraid of slavery gaining more power
Then after that was not a problem, we just made a constitutional amendment that said \xe2\x80\x9cno colonies\xe2\x80\x9d so
The teller amendment
Oh shit
I forget
We should add all 13 at that point***
Dc I forgot it
What?
23rd amendment reminded me
Should just shoot for 12, get cube and pr
Speak English
13, 10 Canada, pr, Cuba, dc
13 states?
boi
Annex all 13
What is it?
All 13 what
10 (canada) + 1(Pr)I + 1(cuba) + 1(dc)
TERRITORIESSS
Ohh
Uh huh
Purto rico is part of the US
=13
Not a state
It\xe2\x80\x99s a territory
It not a state
A non-incorporated territory
If we making more states light as well grab those 3
Yeah
Okay I see now
Yeah
What\xe2\x80\x99s DC?
WASHINGTON DC
OUR CAPITAL
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6UKiPvCaYc
Make that a state?
WE WENT THERE 8TH GRADE BOI HOW U NOT KNOW THAT
Ye
Guys I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be playing this in a month in front of judges
I knew that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what you meant
Good luck
I could name state capitals without google mate
It would be an extremely weak state in congress
guys
So?
So would pr :P
less than 18 hours to alpha release
Already got 3 votes
Yee
Just saying
Still would have a voice
Pr has like nothing
781 Items\n23 Entities\n40 Quests
;-;
Is that enough for alpha? ;-;?
Dc only got 3 from 23rd amendment
QUICK SAY A NUMBER 11-27
22
16
Oh yeah
Black men can vote (all men can)
Waitttt
Yeah
That is a very reasonable and good size for an Alpha.
17
(Easy)
Hmm
Not for me baka I just started learning them all 2 days ago
SENATORS
Senators cannnnnnnnn do something
Really?  US HISTORY CLASS
no
Senators in some way
That was last year...
Not 1-27
I know 1-5
I thought the BoR was supposed to be the easy ones
...
Direct election of senators
O
The first 10 is the bill of rights
Yea
If I remember correctly
Yeah
I like the second amendment
It\xe2\x80\x99s my favorite
I like 3, I get damn privacy
HA it\xe2\x80\x99s inferred privacy
It\xe2\x80\x99s not technically privacy but it should count
Hey, we got Louisiana via guessing
Or soldiers
Yeah
Damn redcoats
You have a constitutional right to """"""""privacy""""""""
Like yeah sure eat all my food and take my bed
Right?
No unlawful search or SEIZURE
Meaning taking
No unlawful SEARCH
They can\xe2\x80\x99t take private such
Meaning looking
They can\xe2\x80\x99t take either
@ NSA peeps reading this rn
Yea I see you
The whole patriot act is unconstitutional
The patriot act that made the NSA was not supposed to be a thing \n\nIt was made via fear
9/11 was an inside job
The middle eastern unrest is completely orchestrated by America and Russia to implement more privacy violations and gain more state control
Russia already has state control left over via the soviets
The last 10 years has been a mess
The last 8 years made us weak
The next 8 will make us S T R O N G E R
YES\n\nIdk actually
In the same sense that fascism made Italy stronger
Not that trump is fascist
Hey now
Careful
Obama\xe2\x80\x99s was more fascist
He used executive orders to make illegal laws
HOW IS THAT NOT FASCIST
don\xe2\x80\x99t defend him.
He made that position very powerful too powerful
My problem with trump is he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on reversing Obama \n\nAnd sense bush senior both parties gain control and reverse the other back and forth
Which ones?
Middle East
Surveillance
Oh
That\xe2\x80\x99s a mess
I personally don\xe2\x80\x99t care about the Middle East \n, I think we should leave
We did what we set out to do
Trumps done more about terrorism than Obama did
Got rid of the dictators we put in power
Husain and the SHAW in Iran
The thing to do about terrorism is to stop creating conditions that breed it
We destabilized the region
And nobody has stated any intention to take any steps in that direction
What we need to do is prop up democratic governments that can actually control its country
Then leave
Don\xe2\x80\x99t let them become dependent on us help
The right way to go at this point, as far as reducing terrorism in America, is to channel all of our military infrastructure to purely defensive operations and humanitarian efforts
No thats Nearly 16 years of fighting
I think we should focus on building stable governments
Stable governments need stable populaces
Stable governments need stable populi
Yeah but ISIS and all of them feed off  of radicalization via victimization
We should work on lowering the price of collage and finding a way to better distribute.
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAH
XD
Stable governments need stable populaces
Yeah right
We should work on lowering the price of collage and finding a way to better distribute school funding
Exactly. So we need to stop making them our victims
But the main groups of al Qaeda are nearly gone, Isis lost its capital and the Taliban has been losing ever since Osama died
Yeah, let\xe2\x80\x99s leave the Middle East
Let them kill eachother see if I care
Too bad we need their oil
I thought that said Obama.
The right way to go at this point, as far as reducing terrorism in America, is to channel all of our military infrastructure to purely defensive operations and humanitarian efforts
Too bad we can still get oil
the dollar is dependent on oil
We don\xe2\x80\x99t need military occupation too keep oil
The world is
cheap oil, we do
less so than you think
No we literally fight with the Russian exports so Europe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t favor Russia over us
So now we see that war in the Middle East is being continued primarily for the benefit of the rich nations?
Probably
(Asking if this is the consensus. It seems to be)
No it\xe2\x80\x99s being used as a power grab for no reason \n\nPlus economic benefits
The Taliban got violent because we left but had them keep the guns
Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we invest in better energy sources (solar/wind/water) and stop fighting over oil?
It\xe2\x80\x99s too costly
Solar uses natural gas to start up
But it\xe2\x80\x99ll pay back in the long run
Not really
ah yes lets destroy the planet
They don\xe2\x80\x99t provide as much power as conventional sources
It will result in less death from fighting over limited resources
Use compressed air engines, they are a real thing
Not necessarily
Well its a concept
Idea: Nuke the Middle East, do exactly what we did to Japanese culture. Make a pacified version of Islam trendy in the West, diluting middle eastern culture with American tourism to the point where middle eastern governments are essentially American puppets
Stop making land mounted wing turbines and start researching how to make them airborne like in big hero 6 (I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some videos on it and it is actually really interesting and effective)
Why do I agree with this somewhat
Actually, put them in the ovens
Actually, put them in the oceans
HAHAHHAAHAHHAAHAHAHA
I\xe2\x80\x99m isolationist
Nukes=anime
Why do you agree with our strategy in colonizing Japan then
I was joking more than anything
We could harness the currents of the ocean to create power on the coasts and we could make very large wind farms in the main land
It would be interesting
No, wind always blows at sea level, have turbines in the coastal waters
The land can be used for housing, farms, etc
Thorium reactors rarely melt down, and thorium is itself rather abundant and cheap
Even the waves can be used as power
google is 100% renewable
Ummmmm then how do hot air balloons work?
3 gigawatts of energy
Hot air rises
Duh
Which creates winds in the upper atmosphere which is also why clouds move
Winds blow way above sea level too
No wind is created via air currents
Wait
Wind is created via wind?
Yeah
for reference, hoover dam which supplies energy to something like 800 million people only produces 2 gigawatts
YES XD
Waves are created by ripples in the water
Yeah the current of the cold air in the atmosphere falling and the warm air from the surface of the wait rising.
Why would we have turbines in the air anyways, it\xe2\x80\x99s just more expensive
And uh programs are created by lots of code
Thorium reactors? Anyone?
Any comments on efficient clean abundant nuclear energy?
I\xe2\x80\x99m for this
Nuclear power is actually very effective
nuclear is gay
They take up less space in the air then on the ground that could be used for housing and business.
Yeah but air traffic
And birds
i prefer VITAMIN D
Maybe
i prefer VITAMIN D ENERGY
But how would we get rid of the inevitable radioactive waste
ya
Space
pfft
Idk
FUSION\n\nWE NEED FUSION
YES
FUSION
IS FUTURE
Just charge the sun with it
Designated zones would become no fly zones for certain altitudes and for birds if we put them high enough we won\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about it
You know it would reduce the life of the sun, right?
FUSION HAS A BI PRODUCT CALLED HEAVY WATER WHICH CAN BE USED AS FUEL
THE MATERIALS THAT IS USED ANYWAYD I FORGET
What about steam engines powered from the heat of the lower crust
Yes
Its possible
And efficient
Geothermal?
guys
guys
guys
That\xe2\x80\x99s already a thing
Thermal power plants on Hawaiis volcanic hot spots and thermal vents
you forget the key reason all this is impossible
oil money
Yes ik
We have to make it where oil makes less money per investment
pfft
nah
Of course not
tesla an fusion is future
Yay let\xe2\x80\x99s kill the planet
Global warming is natural \n\nThe poisonous shit we pump out is the bad part
Yes
I never mentioned global warming
The heat of the core is an infinite power source
That\xe2\x80\x99s what is implied
I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about byproducts effecting the surrounding echo systems and killing off nature to fuel our terrible way of living
"I like the environment and think we should try not to pollute it"\n"Pffft this nerd thinks we cause GLOBAL WARMING gaiz"\n"What now, I just think blue skies in cities and being able to see stars at night would be nice, and-"\n"HAHAHAHAHA CLIMATE CHANGE"
and make the frogs gay
duh
global warming this quickly is not natural
Quickly?? XD
REEE
yeah no
SCIENTIFIC STUDIESSS

Hold up
Conor is a big titty goth girl???
and besides
i dont think madi is interested in anyone in this chat
But we were talking big titty goth
Ok I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna go on a little rant
Okie
Who thinks you should let a puppy do what ever it wants just because it\xe2\x80\x99s a puppy and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know any better
Ex. Pee all over the house, use your other dog as a chew toy, eat stuff off the counter, chew up blankets and pillows.
N O
You gotta teach em young
Now who thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s ok to discipline them and boop their nose or put them in their cage when they\xe2\x80\x99ve done something bad.
Yea that seems logical
Literally zoeys chest is covered in little red scratches from Maggie chewing and scratching at her and my parents response is \xe2\x80\x9cif zoey doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like it she\xe2\x80\x99d fight back\xe2\x80\x9d zoey got attacked by another dog once and you could tell she\xe2\x80\x99s not a fighter because she ran into the corner and cowered till people pulled the other dog off. Sydney never taught zoey to fight back when she didn\xe2\x80\x99t like anything.
Maggie knows no discipline and she\xe2\x80\x99s almost a year old. I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of being yelled at for putting her in time out when she chews on zoey.
Your parents need to be doing that too
My parents don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to have an aggressive younger dog pick on an older one. Rufus my rat terrier lost an eye to a bigger younger dog got aggressive over a begging spot on the floor. Maggie is only maybe 20lbs smaller then zoey and a 1/4th of her age. I do not want Maggie getting bigger then zoey thinking it\xe2\x80\x99s ok to chew on and bite zoey because someone will get hurt.
I had a German Shepard once that we sent back to the pound to get put down because she bit Rufus\xe2\x80\x99s eye out right in front of me when I was a kid. My parents don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to understand I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to put up with a puppy that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know it\xe2\x80\x99s limits.
Either slowly or all at once
Slowly pissing off every human causing everyone yo hate them or attacking someone and getting killed for it

MOM GET THE CAMERA
So Maggie decides she wants a drink. She goes to zoeys bowl and says \xe2\x80\x9cnope this isn\xe2\x80\x99t filled all the way up to the top. I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it to my people to get it filled\xe2\x80\x9d and then proceeds to dump the bowl all over the room and then walk down the hall with a half empty bowl of water dripping everywhere.
I love puppies
She also gets angry when she\xe2\x80\x99s out of water and barks and smacks the bowl
Ooook then

Fucking Josiah goes out with drew and one other guy and they create a new version of the Bari sax pep band packet but he refuses to print me out a copy and then proceeds to tell me he\xe2\x80\x99s playing my Bari. He\xe2\x80\x99s a fucking horn player not a saxophone player.

After I\xe2\x80\x99m done with my solo for solo and ensemble I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna take back my Bari and tell Josiah to suck it up and go back to the horn section full of people who are done with his shit.

I mean, what the Europeans did at first is fine, it was the later genocide of them that I have issues with.
I mean, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t kill them all brutally
Not intentionally anyways
Small pox and shit
I\xe2\x80\x99m talking the ones who didn\xe2\x80\x99t die to that.
Ik
A pretty good amount of them were killed via genocide
The ones who didn\xe2\x80\x99t die to disease were basically hunted for their land
Yeah
They even fought over the few amounts of land between themselves
They tried to make them \xe2\x80\x9ccivilized\xe2\x80\x9d and such but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work
At least they still exist
And we give them gree Indian money
Trail of tears is famous for walking the native Americans into oaklahoma
At least
And we give them free Indian money
They even keep their culture and religion
Oh yeah they all on welfare

If religion and state aren\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to mix why were we forced to say the pledge of allegiance in elementary school which we were taught said \xe2\x80\x9cone nation under god indivisible, with justice for all\xe2\x80\x9d
Hidden mind controlling in the schooling system to make us all religious
@rwarPaws @Emperor_Palpatine @Danny_Dan4  please tell me if I actually have something worth talking about or if I\xe2\x80\x99m just stupid
Yea
It was only added to combat the USSR
So I fully support getting rid of it.
With Conor I mean
Definitely, but we all know how effective slight hints over years can actually be.
If it was anything besides just "under God" then I\
Like I mean even just "under our one true God" would be considered mind control IMO, but "under God" is obscure enough to not matter.
Ok
I HATE SAYING IT
I say one nation indivisible and justice for all
Can I just chant like "heck America heck capitalism heck the police" instead of saying the pledge of allegiance
Go ahead.

Holy fuck
100% charge on 12 minutes
100% charge in 12 minutes
I saw shit about graphene batteries a few months ago
xD
provided energy supply is unlimited in this hypothetical scenario, how much heat would this output when charging
well, USB-C can do up to 12 volts at 9.5 amps
FUCK MY LIFE
All of this, happens during church and we leave church, and come home to my sister in pain and a broken door
It started with an outburst from her and it just went downhill
Well damn
He just broke the door
They were fighting about his dogs
My sister has been screaming at us for 3 days
Non stop
My parents just about called the cops twice in the past 3 days alone
She just threatens random things?
...oh
She threatens to kill her bf, our aunt, she said she would stand in the middle of Roberts road and act insane, and also threatened to not see the family anymore and move away
Empty threats my dad passes off but my mom legit is scared she would do those things
She has a self control issue
Our neigbors even asked what all the yelling was about a couple weeks ago, they said they were gonna call the cops
Well

Like if I was dating someone who threatened to kill me, id call the cops and get a restraining order before breaking up or else could be dangerous
Yeah, i told her bf he should at least consider removing himself from the situation
Yeah ik
My sister refused to get help
First step in solving a problem is recognizing you have one
Yes
Ya know pills and shit
But ya know I\
This past month has been fights after fights with her bf and my parents
I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry...
Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99m at home now
Things are calmed down

Guys Madi is confusing me. She\xe2\x80\x99s talking about this hugs government test tomorrow and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what she\xe2\x80\x99s talking about or if I have to take it or anything
No
Just
Government you have to take
Next year
When take government class
In school
Take big test!
In big room
Many humans, many question, many subjects
So r u taking the test?
Madi speak English
Alright didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean no offense
Don\xe2\x80\x99t scare me like that Madi... I already have a bunch of midterms I have to worry about.
Everyone does don\xe2\x80\x99t act like such a martyr
This
Sorry
An art teacher gives you a deadline and you can\xe2\x80\x99t even have an extra day?
No
Oh
Brainwashing school?
Not really
When ya gonna use those equations and 27 amendments
A good citizen knows his rights
Just
Okay damn
Get to work then Jesus Christ
She mentioned it in a pm so I thought I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear about it and I got scared. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying my worries are more important I\xe2\x80\x99m just say please don\xe2\x80\x99t mention stuff like that to me because not only are my parents making me worry about college already and I have a lot of things I\xe2\x80\x99m stressing over.
Don\xe2\x80\x99t be all butt hurt
Yes.  We all do.
My parents keep making me worry about it too
I have late work I have to do
I have shit to do, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying don\xe2\x80\x99t act like ur the only one
Not to mention they worry too much about my social life
Anyways, let\xe2\x80\x99s not get heated we are all stressed
They have a good reason, they don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to turn out like your older sister.
Sorry...
My older sister was a social butterfly
I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said that
My older sister has her own mistakes that made her this way
Her social life went from great to terrible
All due to drugs
And bad people
She started smoking at 14 that\xe2\x80\x99s her fault, she went that way
They worry about my social life because they don\xe2\x80\x99t want me to have no life in college, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t dated a soul so they worry I won\xe2\x80\x99t get married, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t shown interest in anyone so they are afraid I\xe2\x80\x99m gay, I have a whole different level of worry than my sister before me
My parents are constantly threatening to get me drug tested...
She started smoking and got the wrong friends, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t they know I won\xe2\x80\x99t do drugs
Why?
I also don\xe2\x80\x99t socialize with them because they always get mad at me when I do
Try sleeping
Idk
I sleep too much then don\xe2\x80\x99t sleep enough... my sleep schedule is more messed up then your sisters relationship
God I need to stop
Again this is not necessary
Sorry
Just having bad day
I\xe2\x80\x99ll go...
ARE YOU NOW.
I know you\xe2\x80\x99re having a bad day too
A way worse one then me
Idk bout you but ur day can\xe2\x80\x99t POSSIBLY be worse than mine, I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to be like \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m worse\xe2\x80\x9d or whatever
Which is why I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go so I stop before I make you punch a hole in a wall.
I\xe2\x80\x99m not that posed
I\xe2\x80\x99m not that pissed
Unlike certain people, I\xe2\x80\x99m no hot head
What you\xe2\x80\x99re doing isn\xe2\x80\x99t affecting me, it\xe2\x80\x99s just annoying and your trying to get attention for yourself
No
I don\xe2\x80\x99t want that attention
I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to get attention
Trust me
They why are you directly trying to piss me off
I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to piss you off... bye

Yep seems like Libya definitely went from crappy-but-mostly-livable-"socialist"-dictatorship to extra-crappy-chaotic-anarchy thanks to Freedom(tm)
they went from dictatorship to anarchy and things got worse
Yea

Nope full honest opinion he\xe2\x80\x99s wasting your time
You could have seff find you a fur suit making and get a fur suit before the other guy would make you one thing.
But I told you, I have a class with one of them
You can ignore them
I do
Music in
You could stop sitting with them
But do ignore in favor of music

It will be more boring than waiting for people to finish their PACT
Wait a fucking minute
If you have nothing to do just nap
I might finish shit
Probably will, or use my phone to browse 4chan

Oh I see how it is
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
The crapy music
Is it me or does that give you chills?
I muted it after the first sound it made because I hate it
For some reason listening to that alone in a dark room with you back towards the door didn\xe2\x80\x99t sit well with me
Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me why I\xe2\x80\x99m being a pussy about it
No I understand.
Reminds me of any horror music ever
Yea
Plus I\xe2\x80\x99m a little fucked up from bing playing DDLC on Steam all weekend
That game is scary but phenomenal
Oh, I was trying to watch it but my mom started commenting and then when I finished the first of 5 one hour streams I could start the second on because I had to leave.
That sucks
That game was basically my entire weekend
I mean I took hour long breaks and shit I\xe2\x80\x99m not that much of a tool
I did a lot of lore research for elder scrolls
Sounds good
Your character in that game is a total ass hole to his childhood friend.
Oh yea
I mean you can felt her up after a while but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t move past the fact he was a dick to her
We are talking about DDLC right?

Oi, what if your pet cat identifies as a dog! You are specist if you refer to your pets as anything other than "it" or "animalself". In fact, calling it a pet is slavery! Your animals are just as important, if not more, than you!

why would Obama take credit for it?
I dont remember what he did
Hey David
I found you in this photo explain yourself
Why
O wait maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s owning up to his mistakes
Exactly
The economy is booming so he wants credit
David I\xe2\x80\x99m giving to the chance of surrender
David I\xe2\x80\x99m giving you the chance of surrender
Of course
He\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for the slowest economic recovery from a recession in US history
We still haven\xe2\x80\x99t recovered
And the banks are making the same mistakes as before
DID NOBODY LEARN FROM 2008?
If he\xe2\x80\x99s French he already did lmao
Yes, but the money didn\xe2\x80\x99t.
Stop using notability to make memes David
The banks are causing a new one just like last time and it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be worse
Exactly.
Those who have the ability to bribe politicians want this to happen, as they will continue to be even richer.
Pretty much
Those are the same shitheads that said that the banks are \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big to fail\xe2\x80\x9d
Despite the official investigation pointing it to be the banks fault
Inflating the housing market
You can\xe2\x80\x99t be too big to fail that\xe2\x80\x99s not how this works
Yep
Let the banks fail
Everyone switch to bitcoin
No just
Uhhhh
No
xD
Why not xD
Break up the banks, put the momey back into congress, force them to manage money, remove the federal reserve or replace it, then STOP PRINTING WORTHLESS MONEY
Momey
No stop
No
NO
BITCOIN IS BEST
i don\xe2\x80\x99t wanna read money as momey

MY DUDE
MY DUDES
AAAA
AAAAAA
ok so
that looks hella gay
bout to get eaten out by a potato
Wait is there an economic downturn happening right now
no?
Not yet, but from what alex is saying, we\xe2\x80\x99re getting close to what happened in 2008
House prices has gone up for no reason \n\nMy house has gained 200,000 value out of no where
The banks are raising prices as soon as people move out
ugh
Yeah that\xe2\x80\x99s a side effect of the housing bubble back in 2008 iirc
tis the result of not doing fuckin anything
Nobody has faith in the establishment as is
too bad theyre gonna make it a partisam issue
too bad theyre gonna make it a partisan issue
pffft
Vs. Centrist McBothSides from the Democrats
less government is fascist?
Less government but also stronger borders and stronger police force and stronger national identity and strong antifeminism and push to more traditional values...
No matter how much they say "less government" none of their values really fit that
more like make borders actually mean something\nI hvent seen anything about that\nis national identity bad?\nthe current new wave feminism is not feminism.
It\xe2\x80\x99d be more likely to have a fascist in the democratic side of things.
I can see that too
"stronger borders" is relative
(((These are all characteristics of a fascist system)))
Considering they spent the last eight years increasing federal power and making the power of the president more.....powerful yeah I can see that
yeah
\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s increase the debt ceiling and PRINT MORE MONEY\xe2\x80\x9d
Congress, 2016
I don\xe2\x80\x99t disagree, but yeah, the ideals the republican side has tends to be quite against fascists.
"lets make so many shitty decisions, then name the decisions fun names so people are shunned for being against it like "affordable care act" then crash the economy again to convince socialism is the answer"
"lets make so many shitty decisions, then name the decisions fun names so people are shunned for being against it like "affordable care act" then crash the economy again to convince everyone socialism is the answer"
Basically the past eight years of domestic policy
While the way the democratic side is going would allow for fascists to take hold with ease, provided their ideals were satisfactory to most, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be exactly \xe2\x80\x9cfor the people\xe2\x80\x9d
+German
+Germany
Germany is fucked
Completely
Thanks to, you guessed it, MUSLIMS
Oh yea
The sex crimes there are astronomical
less government is the answer
Traditional values don\xe2\x80\x99t lead to fascism but I agree
Actually, just that alone doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow for it.
Yes
and democrats dont want less government
That will harm their hold on power
Of course not
The latter would be more likely to create a tyranny, but not necessarily \xe2\x80\x9cfascist\xe2\x80\x9d
The democrats, or congress in general is just a bunch of jackasses who are bought and paid for every election
^
The markets benefit from mild WELL PLACED regulation
WELL THOUGHT OUT regulation
not knee-jerk bans
The regulation of the banks before the 90\xe2\x80\x99s was great
There isn\xe2\x80\x99t, but fascist ideals don\xe2\x80\x99t always create a dictatorship
The banks literally control the regulators
Ok so we get fucked over a bit less but we still have all the same problems of--
pfft
Every system has issues.
Capitalism has less than most.
^
Why do you always attack capitalism your own system is not without flaws
Communism fucks everyone over equally
Equality!
And currently, we need to repair the system we have presiding over capitalism
Yay let\xe2\x80\x99s all wait for 4 hours in a bread line
The only flaw ancom has shown in its implementations thus far is an inability to protect itself from outside militaristic forces
We need to actually let the free market do it\xe2\x80\x99s thing
We need to return to the states having more power than the federal government.
The government can\xe2\x80\x99t fix everything
And it\xe2\x80\x99s ability to protect itself against itself
No?
And inside forces
Because every system will have those who want to break it apart.
You need to accommodate for that.
Where did that happen?
On paper, democracies and republics work amazingly!
The problem with ancom is that how tf will you have regulations if there\xe2\x80\x99s no government
Show me one place ancom has been tested
that has lasted longer than 5 years
Just in practice, you end up with \xe2\x80\x9cmy ignorance is equal to your research\xe2\x80\x9d
But this is America, they are the best and fuck all who appose
left vs right :3
Except with that it\
I do feel a good democracy would be one that requires you to learn about an issue before you\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to vote on it, but that isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly viable.
Both sides do this.
Hell, everyone does this to some extent.
The left doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even consider everyone\xe2\x80\x99s feelings if you wanna go that route
Shhh
exactly
We have reached a-morality\n\nThis is where great civilizations fall
Eh
It killed the Romans and the Greeks
We\xe2\x80\x99re at a point never before seen.
Thank the internet for that.
The \n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything is okay\xe2\x80\x9d attitude is what creates this
Again self defense is the issue. Best I can give is Catalonia. But it was promising
It\xe2\x80\x99s okay to change ur gender blah blah blah
Eh
With thunderous applause
You clearly have no inkling of how ancom works
Do you want me to tear that argument a new one again.
It\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting system for sur
Down boy, down
The people cannot be relied on for governing, as you have two sides on an issue, no matter how stupid each side is.
Yup
The people cannot be relied on for governing, as you have two sides on an issue, no matter how stupid one side is.
The people cannot be relied on for governing, as you have people supporting two sides on an issue, no matter how stupid one side is.
It\xe2\x80\x99s a commune it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a full system
^yeah basically
This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean an elite class of course, but you need some sort of power structure to instil order and law
Exactly.
it used to exist in the US
too bad money changed that :D
What is this even supposed to mean
A system where the government is made by the people for the people
Our system, but it needs work
Pff
You have those who are above you in law, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be truly elite class kind of thing
You have to have those who are above you in law, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be truly elite class kind of thing
Nobody is above the law
Unless they have money
Congress has forgotten this
That\xe2\x80\x99s our modern system
Senators and reps are public servents, or at least they should be
It\xe2\x80\x99s completely justified, as people aren\xe2\x80\x99t exactly the best at self-governing
Humans naturally make a power structure
Animals do it naturally
It was a commune which means that it was a small town or state that tried it but was fully funded by a larger government meaning it didn\xe2\x80\x99t sustain itself.
Sadly, they\xe2\x80\x99ve kinda lost that status and are now more self-serving
Exactly
But we smart human, we know everything
rich countries have tried forms of communism and went subsequently horribly broke
Bad forms yea
it doesnt work
No true Scotsman
There\xe2\x80\x99s a article in the constitution where we can reset the government
We don\xe2\x80\x99t
I guess, all systems have their bad versions
Oh I know, just making fun
Wait seriously?
Dead serious
Sauce pls
No shit?
Real shit?
It\xe2\x80\x99s less of that and more Collin pulling the no true Scotsman fallacy, or whatever it was called
Ok
I agree
*ipad
*no shit
That\
I am critisizing their actions
not that it was communism
whatever
i dont believe communism would ever work
What I\
I mean seriously
they still managed to eventually fuck it up
Leftist analysis points it back to capitalism
PFFFFFFFFFFF
Leftist analysis would always point it back to capitalism
@Danny_Dan4 here\xe2\x80\x99s ur sauce

Congress has to listen, the constitution also says you can pettitioj the government to settle grievances (first amendment \n)
Alright this is getting no where David if you will
We covered all these topics in a private conversation
Send in the Calvary
What would you propose them
What would you propose then
We nuke congress?
Violent revolution, like how we started the country, perhaps
Remember this
If you want to restart you gotta do the start of it again
That would work
yes lets let people die v:
I\xe2\x80\x99m talking the convo in general
Still kinda irrelevant to the topic currently being discussed
Sadly, nowadays, when trying to go against people who are literally the largest military in the world, it\xe2\x80\x99s basically just \xe2\x80\x9cdo you want to get wiped off the planet.

If all else fails
And we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even have the advantage of enemies have a lack of communication.

I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking lately, if god is real and is all good and great then why does he want to kill us. Why do we have all these earthquakes and tsunamis and horrible world events?
TIL that some scientists theorize that the origin of life is just the inevitable outcome of thermodynamics as a middle-step to increase overall entropy in the universe. [Source]
And some scientists theorize the earth is flat, so what
It me
It is Monday, my fellow associates
Ur gay??
@Emperor_Palpatine @rwarPaws ?
Because God didn\xe2\x80\x99t make the earth perfect
Why
We were exiled from edge
We were exiled from Eden
Eden was perfect
I don\xe2\x80\x99t question it
When you actually go and read the Bible, he gaslighted to some insane extent with Adam and Eve
Then I don\xe2\x80\x99t get my answer
Thus why ur a communist
What?
*slap*
Why did god make the world not perfect. It\xe2\x80\x99s like he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to kill us
Morality is what keeps a functional society, once morality is gone, no more society \n\nSimply, put
We can agree on morals as a society without thinking of them as absolutes
Or even as proven
Think of it as punishment, Eden was safe from the world.  And then we were exiled and left to the world
We can toy with different ideas in terms of right and wrong, simply because there is no right answer
Law of conservation of energy states energy is neither created nor destroyed, so where did anything come from? There has to be some higher power that created everything
I have a theory that God made the earth, and then watched it do it\xe2\x80\x99s thing naturallly, and was like \xe2\x80\x9cwoah\xe2\x80\x9d
Never thought of it that way
But isn\xe2\x80\x99t god all good so he would want us to be safe?
Most don\xe2\x80\x99t
It putting you down or anything
We betrayed him, original sin.  Of course he does but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t meddle in human affairs
He gave us free will
Not putting you down or anything
What do you mean free will?
He gave us a world and we are killing it. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope this is just the free trial so we can have another shot once we know what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.
You know.  Choice
Nah everything just always existed
Choice of what
And not existed at the same time
ANYTHING
Every thing has a start and an end, where did anything start
Plus who created that everything
Everything has always existed in its basic elements
It all started when yo mama grabbed her lawn chair and popcorn and watched the Big Bang.
Prove it
Where you there
He has his own religion, he does not need to prove anything just like you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to prove anything.
Mini rant: carbon dating is bull shit
So by your logic because of eden and all the stuff that happened there, we have cancer, earthquakes, diseases, asteroids that head forward earth?
It different for everyone
Actually
We\xe2\x80\x99ve hit lower
O
Lowest this month
We\xe2\x80\x99re just having a discussion
Idk man
I agree
We aren\xe2\x80\x99t fighting we are just talking
Exactly
:/
I though everything through in the shower Friday
I invented my religion through about a month of reasoned debate, inspired by Buddhism and science fiction novels
Is there a communism religion?
Like who created god, why does god do god things, what\xe2\x80\x99s the reason god exists, is this a just a loop, some higher higher power created god, god created us, could we create our own race, we do actually
GMOs
My religion has vaguely communistic leanings
We constantly use 100% of them, actually.
We may not be maxing its capabilities, but that\xe2\x80\x99s to prevent damaging them.
We may not be maxing its capabilities, but that\xe2\x80\x99s to prevent damaging it.
I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that about most people I met
There\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between being an idiot and actually not using your brain
The brain is specialized.
Yet equally plastic in what it specializes in.
Yes
Different parts of the brain do different things
Well that\xe2\x80\x99s just a theory
A game theory?
Of course tizy wizy says it first lol
If Elon Musk is successful with his low earth orbit satellite internet Comcast is in deep shit.
Actually if you\xe2\x80\x99re Elon musk it is a game theory
The "not all of your brain" is a lie, all parts of your brain have proven functions that operate under certain conditions\n\nWe aren\

At this point, who isn\xe2\x80\x99t a sexual harasser
I made the mistake of watching that part at 1:00AM
At this point, who isn\xe2\x80\x99t a sexual harasser/abuser
Innocent until proven guilty
Oy m8
^this
It also happened 20 Year\xe2\x80\x99s ago so no way to prove it
It also \xe2\x80\x9chappened\xe2\x80\x9d 20 Year\xe2\x80\x99s ago so no way to prove it
Unless you have perfect evidence with a perfect amount of witnesses

Because no one will expect it
No
No
That
Yes
No

You can\xe2\x80\x99t make a character trans out of no where that\xe2\x80\x99s not how this works

Okay then
Tru
Is this commenting on the nature of conformity in schools and such?
Although
That could be a moral to take from it
It works better as a \xe2\x80\x9cquestion authority\xe2\x80\x9d as well
Don\xe2\x80\x99t just be like \xe2\x80\x9coh okay\xe2\x80\x9d question it
Eh, I think it\
Idk I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how it can be \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ignore me\xe2\x80\x9d because it\xe2\x80\x99s about that pebble and the lines that say she\xe2\x80\x99s told not to Question where it comes from
How it got there
No she is the pebble
And people are deliberately not questioning where she came from
Ahh
Ohhhh ohh I see
It says \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t take a second glance\xe2\x80\x9d okay
Although taking interest in everyone you pass by seems like a bit much
Sure it\xe2\x80\x99s not preferable to just be another passerby but people just don\xe2\x80\x99t really take interest unless they see or hear something of interest from that person
Heard something about them or saw them do something
I don\
Well yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying why it\xe2\x80\x99s kinda hard
Right right
I can see the loneliness part
I can see the struggle of just wanting people to take interest in her, or the pebble as the poem said
I think being valued by everyone isn\xe2\x80\x99t something to be desired, being noticed as someone of interest by someone else is something to be desired, someone else took interest in you out of all people.  \n\nYeah that sounds about right
Some of the spaces look weird in Tele
I just noticed, metal and hard rock are the same thing XD \n\nBUT but, its needed to get to the pebble thing
Ha!!
You son of a bitch
Metal and hard rock are NOT the same thing
Dude.  They are BASICALLY the same thing
I listen to BOTH there is LITTLE TO NO DIFFERENCE
The only difference being noticeable is that the lyrics are more pronounced then the music In hard rock
Not the same
https://www.thetoptens.com/differences-between-hard-rock-heavy-metal/
Not the same
Shut down
Only 1 of you said any evidence for as to why
The rest of you just wanted to gangbang me
Considering they have different names makes them different in this situation
This is pointless I\xe2\x80\x99ve realized
Not to mention, some bands can have a mix of the two genres
Music can be pretty free-form like that
I mean
I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard bands change genre mid song lmao
Music is flexible in most cases ur right
Its common place for gorillaz to have rap verses in their songs too
Have you tried suicide
Yeah
Fuck genres
HAD ME DEAD
you listen to genres?  That\xe2\x80\x99s so last century

That actually end up sounding good.

Flags are typically centered tho so your Switzerland and Japan are wrong
Japan has the rising sun flag, that\xe2\x80\x99s the old Swiss flag before it was centered
During world war 2 that was the flag of the Swiss
Scratch that, that\xe2\x80\x99s an older flag
Whoops

You racist
But that\xe2\x80\x99s funny
I love when my parents don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that they got a baby sitter for the night so I come home from my moms and then I\xe2\x80\x99m greeted by some emo looking girl who\xe2\x80\x99s probably only a year older than me who didn\xe2\x80\x99t know I was gonna show up because my parents forgot to mention to them that I exist.
O
BANG HER\n\n\nNo I\xe2\x80\x99m joking
My dad just walked in and said \xe2\x80\x9cnice job scaring the living shit out of the baby sitter, we never thought to mention you after we introduced the two younger siblings\xe2\x80\x9d
Lol
Ur parents arnt the smartest
No offense
None taken, I kinda agree
No seriously what kind of parent just assumes they won\xe2\x80\x99t see a child, they can at least say \xe2\x80\x9cmy son Conor may or may not appear so don\xe2\x80\x99t be scared\xe2\x80\x9d
You say these things to avoid confusion and so that said babysitter doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get caught off guard by a new person in the house
Alright rant over
I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed a lot of girls our age, babysit as jobs more so than before
They don\xe2\x80\x99t go to McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s or whatever they become babysitters
I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed I hang around more girls then guys recently.
Owo
\xe0\xbc\xbc \xe3\x81\xa4 \xe2\x97\x95_\xe2\x97\x95 \xe0\xbc\xbd\xe3\x81\xa4
I get along better because there\xe2\x80\x99s no need for competition, we all know I have the biggest tits. And when surrounded by girls I can just sit back and relax and they can make me laugh and it really alleviates stress.
O
I mean I guess
With guys I can\xe2\x80\x99t express as much emotion and there\xe2\x80\x99s always constant trying to one up each other. I just wanna sit back and relax for a bit.
Oh yeah! Well I.....I.....cry my self to sleep at night!
XD
Emotion shows weakness, NO WEAK ONLY LOGIC
I know what to get you for Christmas, a box of tissues for your \xe2\x80\x9ctears\xe2\x80\x9d
I don\xe2\x80\x99t cry
I actually have to work more on expressing emotion because I have to put a lot of emotion into my solo in a month.
Hm
My solo is about losing a loved one and thinking back on all the fun times you had together.
See why I need to put emotion into it.
guys put too much stock in being stoic
not healthy
Stoic is like heroic and strong right?
Not really heroic
emotionless, strong, unmoving
Oh
Yeah
Can we just go back to the beginning of all this social expectations stuff and fix it. We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be asking our gf to make us a sandwich and do the laundry and she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to deal with us not expressing emotion and being stupid.
Well it worked for thousands of years
Not gonna change in one generation
Why should it change?
I mean women entered a workforce that was only built to handle half the population, women came in and doubled the amount of available workers. Wages dropped because supply of workers far outweighed the demand.
Ew
Just sayin
Seff did you go to college?
No
Ok
Well kinda
Oh
A thousand bucks a month to learn shit I already know or will never use? Pfft
True, but at least If I go I will be working with something I kinda enjoy and should be able to make a schedule I will enjoy where I don\xe2\x80\x99t start my day at 7 am in honors chem.
What ya going for?
A degree in music education and performance.
:o
Debating if the extra money and time is worth it to get a doctorates in music.
*Walks into class on first day* hello everyone my name is mister doctor Patric
Mr doctor progression Patrick
Sorry forgot the professor.
Mr doctor professor Patrick
Fuckin autocorrect
Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll go for a bachelors degree and then once I get out and get a somewhat steady job or maybe start looking into job options I\xe2\x80\x99ll do that thing where you can go and get your masters online and then go back once I have a nice steady job for sure and get my doctorates degree?
Steady job? In THIS economy?
:P
Seff do I look like I know what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about, the closest to a steady job I\xe2\x80\x99ll ever get is the $100 a month for mowing my neighbors lawn.
Which reminds me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me forget to text him saying I\xe2\x80\x99ll do January for free.

Pfft. The internet was perfectly fine for the twenty years the FTC handled it.
Had the FTC actually gone against anti-competitive practices in the past, I would actually be ok with getting rid of NN
Because the internet was different 15 or even 7 years ago
Cable doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have as much of an issue as the internet.
The internet is something that is on a whole different level
It\xe2\x80\x99s at a point though where if ISPs have this ability, they could, and more than likely will, cause massive issues.
Speculation
It\xe2\x80\x99s at a point though where if ISPs have this ability, they could, and more than likely will, cause massive issues, across the globe.
Definitely, that\xe2\x80\x99s what NN is for.
No.
NN made the internet title 2.
You just contradicted yourself
Let\xe2\x80\x99s just sit back with a bucket of popcorn and watch how things work out.
The internet is one system that would benefit greatly if it was entirely dealt with by the govt.
The only upside is that competition could form
The downsides are way higher than is worthwhile
What are the downsides? I bet the FCCs plan covers it.
The ability to have plans that allow for ISPs to systematically sensor people, for one.
Pfft
They have the ability to do just short of anything, provided they\xe2\x80\x99re transparent in what they do.
Why are plans a bad thing? No ISP in their right mind would block all traffic. It would be hell to manage.
"social media package" ah yes now let\
Pfft
Is it me or is the ugliest person i ever seen?
Ajit pair is dad
Ajit pai is dad
You spelled his name wrong dumbass
Ignorant masses of uneducated people start riots because they are getting charged differently for internet
Whitelisting sites.
Define.
You\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised.
More than likely falls under anticompetitive practice laws and either way the FTC has regulation against that
Extreme backlash on part of the consumers as well
FCC has also stated that abusing the lax regulation will lead to it being reinstated
Which is the LAST thing ISPs want
C\
\xe2\x80\x9cOh no the world is out to get me\xe2\x80\x9d
If they turn out to be issues, competition WILL sprout up.
Which is always good.
Awooo
You seem to care because you responded :P
Sadly, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t enforce it in the past in Comcast vs BitTorrent, I think the website in question was.
Taco
Me setting up decorations
Technically they can\xe2\x80\x99t censor you
Constitutional right
Ummmm YouTube does its, why cant the internet?
If they did that would be a huge un constitutional legal fest of shit
Because the internet is bigger than the US
Have you met North Korea? They have internet censorship.
The censor shop of the hole internet can\xe2\x80\x99t be done unless you block international traffic
They arnt connected to the internet
the government cant, companies can do it all they want
Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s their company, they can do what they want with it
ISP\xe2\x80\x99s would have to block international traffic just to block anything they want
Ex. School
Yes
It\xe2\x80\x99s just not a sound business decision
Because people would file lawsuits
The countries with regulated censorship are blocked by the government
China for example just censors ALL traffic
North Korea has its own network not connected to the greater internet
It\xe2\x80\x99s nerf or nothing
Damnit
We should buy an island off the cost of some country and then susses from the nation and create a new world and make our one laws
We need UN recognition
Sealand
Citizens
Unclaimed territory which is hard to find
All the islands in the pacific are owned by someone
Same in the Atlantic
Same for the world
Same in the Indian Ocean
Yeah
Everywhere is claimed
Colonize Antarctica
Bir tawil isn\xe2\x80\x99t claimed by anyone
Even the moon
Too cold and inhospitable
There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing there
Plus it\xe2\x80\x99s against international law
The UN protects Antarctica
Bir tawil got oil in it
Where?
It\xe2\x80\x99s probs claimed
No, claims in outer space are not recognized
We can research it and camp on it, but colonization is illegal
Oh I know
Plus Outer space Treaty of 1967 which states no sovereignty over space
Yeah
Can we claim asteroids?
No
We have plans to mine them
You can\xe2\x80\x99t claim anything in space
Don\xe2\x80\x99t you have to have posesion over it to mine it?
The UN doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really clearly state anything about that
Its technically illegal to buy space
So unless given permission by a government, you can\xe2\x80\x99t mine annoying
So unless given permission by a government, you can\xe2\x80\x99t mine anything
Without regulations to follow about mining there will be conflict with people fighting over who gets to mine what...
No
World War III the first space war
There would be legal issues
No
World war 3 will be nuclear if it happens mate
But all you can do is stare at it and say \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s pretty\xe2\x80\x9d
But we cant put nukes in space
The shortest war in history
;-;
Yup
A few hours at most
WWIV is fought with stones and glass
There will be no sticks after the fires sweep the world
That\xe2\x80\x99s the thing, they\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to.
With one simple fact.
Because the freedom of speech thing only applies to government level censorship.
The internet is one thing where net neutrality may not be needed, but where the internet is so crucial to the entire globe that any risk taking would be disastrous if it fails, especially when the risk wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even necessary
That\xe2\x80\x99s my thing with net neutrality, sure it may fix a nonexistent issue, but the risks involved with not having it far outweigh the negatives of having it.
I think you just gave a perfect reason as to why nothing bad will happen.
It fixes an issue that never existed and stifles innoveation and network expansion. It causes more issues than it solves.
It fixes an issue that never existed and stifles innovation and network expansion. It causes more issues than it solves. Which is none.
What about to the same sex tho
WOAH
Exactly
That\xe2\x80\x99s the thing though, I said the negatives are heavily outweighed by the risks, not that they don\xe2\x80\x99t exist.
I personally believe that the benefits outweigh the risks.

This song is stuck in my head
Maeve Pendragon: 01. Faun - Mit dem Wind
I had multiple examples of companies fucking people over by throttling certain connections, but I ended up forgetting what exactly they were, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t re-look them up because I\xe2\x80\x99m in class
I had multiple examples of companies fucking people over in this exact manner by throttling certain connections, but I ended up forgetting what exactly they were, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t re-look them up because I\xe2\x80\x99m in class
Keep in mind, the less stress on the companies\xe2\x80\x99 servers through means like throttling popular connections, the less they spend on the same priced plan, thus the more they make, at the expense of the customer
You do realize you are talking to yourself at the moment right?
And if they have a whitelist system where only paying companies get into their networks, they earn more money than before
Your point?
I got no point to make
Just saying
They\xe2\x80\x99d probably do a blacklist, but have whitelisted full speed connections
Actually they can completely kill connections with the new system
And literally everyone would cancel their plan
Or pay what they did before anyways
No
One broadband
Not one internet service provider
Nobody wants dialup.
Cell data exists
Satellite too
PFFFFFFFFFFFF
My cell data plan works fine playing games anyways
...you do realize that\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean, right?
Dialup != Cellular data
There\xe2\x80\x99s many areas where all you have is one carrier, for literally everything
At all
Where they have a monopoly on the area\xe2\x80\x99s internet
And millions would be possed
And millions would be pissed
Someone say something shocking
At all
That\xe2\x80\x99s the thing, you\xe2\x80\x99d pay more to have your favorite sites unlocked.
Like TV
Yeah and I doubt they charge me more than the 60 a month they charge me now
They would in a heartbeat.
For 20 mb service.
Doubtful
Nothing stopping rhem
Just add some surcharges
They know they can\xe2\x80\x99t, so they\xe2\x80\x99ll just slowly introduce it so you don\xe2\x80\x99t realize what\xe2\x80\x99s going on before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late.
Nothing stopping them
Pfft
They know they can\xe2\x80\x99t instantly, so they\xe2\x80\x99ll just slowly introduce it so you don\xe2\x80\x99t realize what\xe2\x80\x99s going on before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late.
Ur the gay
No.
Yes.
Sure, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve done this in the past and were completely overlooked by the FTC
Show me.
You keep saying that
Sauce pls
Yeah don\xe2\x80\x99t go around asking for sauce from other people and not have sauce urself
https://www.pcworld.com/article/139795/article.html
There was a case a few years ago, 2013 or 14 I think with Netflix and Comcast, but that was only possible because of a 2010 regulation change.
Back in 2007, before NN
David\xe2\x80\x99s a sinner
Veridan, NN, title 2, was like putting someone in quarantine in a maximum security prison because they COUGHED on someone.
No.
Yes.
You keep using that term, what exactly does title 2 mean and why is it related to title 2
I can assumed based on context, but I\xe2\x80\x99d like a clarification.
NN turned all ISPs no matter how big or small into a title 2 common carrier under FCC regulations.
NN turned all ISPs no matter how big or small into a title 2 common carriers under FCC regulations.
NN turned all ISPs no matter how big or small into title 2 common carriers under FCC regulations.
And what does title 2 imply?
Put simply? If you want to walk somewhere you need to ask Daddy.
Daddy seff?
That sounds like a very good system.
It sounds like people still have copper cabled and 5mb service.
It sounds like people still have copper cable and 5mb service.
Shhhh he\xe2\x80\x99s busy
If you want to fuck someone over, you need to confirm with the govt.
But mam
Explain why
No
Go to ur room and shush
This is a good show a, I right?
*gives mada popcorn*
No
*noms angerly*
If it benefits them monetarily, yes it is.
Yeah
This is a good show right?
Fine, don\xe2\x80\x99t bother him then
If they fuck you over they lose business or can be subject to government regulation.
A business\xe2\x80\x99s job is to earn money, they earn the most money by finding the balance between giving as little service as to make you happy with as spending as much as possible.
There was no indication at all, ever, that ISPs were going to fuck anyone over.
A business also needs to weigh the benefits of upgrading their service.
Right now there is no benefit.
And if they can shift that balance to make you pay more, they will. And removing net neutrality will allow them to shift it.
There is no competition.
For a modern need.
You said yourself that removing regulation could help bring in competition.
But nowhere near enough in key issue areas.
No, they try and find the cheapest way to do it with a balanced accepted level of service
That\xe2\x80\x99s what I said
A company provides the best service when there is competition.
Oh
So you did
The actors can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you through the TV
In a rather complicated manner, but he\xe2\x80\x99s.
Fug
DONT YOU DARE KILL HAN SOLO YOU MOTHER FU- BEN
But the government can
Veridan, tell me.
Say you own an isp
IMO we should do away with ISP companies entirely, and place internet access in the place of directly government controlled systems
XD HAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
HAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHA
But I have yet to do research on the implications of this, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the advantages and disadvantages of this.
OMG SEAN THATS FUNNY
WEW
No, seriously.
The government could say no! Charging extra on these new lines for a few months to offset costs of laying cable is bad!
Alex calm down you\xe2\x80\x99re scaring the children
No china has that and it\xe2\x80\x99s regulated to government approved sites
Did I just fucking read that
You basically are asking for the government to censor and block
She\xe2\x80\x99s fine
Yeah, Sean this isn\xe2\x80\x99t your best idea
Look no further than china to see how that one ends
While I\xe2\x80\x99m open to this idea, it seems other examples of this have been poor
Definitely, but if I do recall correctly, South Korea did this as well, and you see what they\xe2\x80\x99re like.
We just need to figure out how to separate the service and the infrastructure businesses.
No.....?
Sauce pls
Tbh I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but I know they have government funded direct connections to every house, with all internet cost being in taxes
That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it government provided internet
Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it though?
Since it\xe2\x80\x99s funded by taxes
That just means the infrastructure was funded by the government
No the direct links is like water and power lines, it\xe2\x80\x99s provided by water companies and electric companies.
But built by the government
Also, there\xe2\x80\x99s many different towns where they did the exact same thing, and those towns are now the biggest cities in Silicon Valley
Maintained via bills to the private company
When your life just becomes a series of ups and downs.
So the government brings the horse to water, but we\xe2\x80\x99re the ones who make it drink
Yeah
Yep
Gotcha
I hate learning vibrato
It\xe2\x80\x99s not the governments place to make it drink
Vibrato is different for everyone, you have to get a feel for it and get comfortable with it
The government just makes sure nobody else kills or touches the house
Or invades it
The government just makes sure nobody else kills or touches the horse
But it\xe2\x80\x99s sucks because it\xe2\x80\x99s all microscopic jaw movements and I need to make it stay in tune yet sound good.
These places have about $10 a month for 100 Mbit/s connections (I think it\xe2\x80\x99s higher than that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have exact numbers for it)
Sauce pls
I\xe2\x80\x99d try recording yourself and then listening then try to improve from there
No
The numbers I have no source for
I\xe2\x80\x99m watching a pitch analysis thing.
Where did you get them
More people to offset the cost of laying infrastructure
Bullshitted those numbers based off google fiber
That\xe2\x80\x99s what I thought
I had $60 for 5mb down in a city of 300
For those exact numbers
You\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised.
I would not
It cost my father... 5 thousand? To run fiber thirty feet to the house.
Labor. Not by the ISP.
Labor. Not paid to the ISP.
*low-pitch whistle*
That\xe2\x80\x99s
That\xe2\x80\x99s quite a bit
Might have been 3k
Idfk
Now take that number
And multiply it over 8 miles to get from the closest city to here
Let\xe2\x80\x99s see
There\xe2\x80\x99s like i dont know
XD
1500 feet in a mile
3k for 30 feet f cable
3k for 30 feet of cable
100$ a foot of cable
Then you have maintenance costs, switches, routers, staff, servers, etc
$150,000 in cable alone
Well that includes digging and labor costs
And that\xe2\x80\x99s with the cheapest number
Hence the \xe2\x80\x9calone\xe2\x80\x9d part in that statement
And the ISP probably has a discounted rate for long distances
But the point stands
Infrastructure? Expensive.
There\xe2\x80\x99s lots of other factors that go along with that too
Honestly it was a tad more than 30 feet actually
Not to mention maintenance
Whatever
Expensive
I mistyped but like
Whatever
Keeping that stuff alive, fixing it if broken blah blah blah lots of money
How long is a foot
Wait... A foot
Suh
Look at a foot
Duh
Ur foot
One foot is 12 inches
It\xe2\x80\x99s that long
What?
Less money?
That makes no sense
Where\xe2\x80\x99s the appeal in thay
Where\xe2\x80\x99s the appeal in that
If I owned a business in general earning less money is not good
Massive costs in big businesses is the cost of internet.
One of the massive costs in big businesses is the cost of internet.
Look, if you own a business, you take all that into account. Say it cost 150k to bring internet in, and you do a 5 year repayment plan and only have 500 customers.\n\n60 a month. Wow that worked out perfectly.
Then maintenance costs, labor, routers for each house
Cost of idiots
Good job seff, keep it up! Proud of u
Yes
Is that a problem?
Other countries had it easy, fiber existed when they laid the infrastructure
But we had copper.
Still have
Also other countries subsidize isps
I wonder what goes into fiber that makes them so expensive
You end up earning enough economic boost for the investment of infrastructure that it ends up paying for itself after about 5 years
Glass.
Handling it is difficult
Glad
It breaks easily
Glass
Very, very high quality glass.
Not really
Need special tools, special training
No, the point is that it\xe2\x80\x99s strong
But relatively, yes.
Yes
So handling labor is in high demand and low supply?
Why would they invest so much money into something thay breaks easily
Yeah basically
That too
Fast
More users on one cable
Up to 100 Gbit/s currently.
With no known final cap, as you can use multiple bands
It used to be the size of a bus
Idfk
No.
The telegraph line(s) that it was was huge
Yes.
So about the size of your forearm
Your... Foot
xD
No, actually.
The point is, isps make enough money now without upgrading. We need competition. Title 2 makes competition difficult.
Forcing upgrades ahh
Personally I think we need to separate the infrastructure business from the ISP business.
I feel we should modify it to be more welcoming, not remove it entirely.
But separating them now would fuck SOMEONE over
Remove it. Replace it.
http://www.beldencables-emea.com/en/products/cable_basics/fiber-optic-cable/index.phtml
Definitely.
Fix issues as they arise.
They want to permanently remove it
No
They said multiple times in their plan that "if they abuse this lax regulation, it will be reinstated"
Like
Cmon
Blatant lying dude
Sauce pls
Yeah, like electric companies are separate from construction
And also, they probably only said that so they have any appeal at all
Dude...

76% that actually care to answer about it.
Silent majority.
How do you know what size that is though?
How do you?
Vs. a vocal 24 percent minority?
Who really knows what the actual number is?
Why do you think Trump won
Because our system has things in place that can bias slightly from the majority, but not a supermajority as high as 66% or more
(I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell if ur joking)
Well he won yes? What did the polls say
He lost?
The popular vote by about 2% iirc
Before or after recount?
After made it closer
\xe2\x80\x9cRecount\xe2\x80\x9d heh.
So yeah, afyer
So yeah, after
1000 people, 76%? What people, what state, what browser, where did you ask, what did you ask.
So, would a larger sample size fix this problem?
Yes.

When you drink alcohol, are you just borrowing happiness from tomorrow ?
No. Because alcohol does not cause happiness at all. You are borrowing more rapid death though.
The relaxation from the drunkness could be considered happiness, and in that case, it would be.
But that\xe2\x80\x99s purely a matter of opinion.
True. I am not a good judge of it, as I last drank alcohol at the age of eight, got totally smashed/blackout drunk, did not enjoy.  Decided not to do that again. Perhaps someone whom habitually murders brain cells would be a better judge.

(lookin at you comcast)\n\nNo collusion. (still lookin at you)\n\nNo consumer abuse\n\nNo unfair business practice
Probably not but the possibility exists now
If net neutrality is repealed it will just go back to how it was 2 Year\xe2\x80\x99s ago

Not yet, the FCC would need to get approval by one of the other parts of government to fuck us over by removing it.
Sadly, not necessarily.
No
Aka only if you have time Warner or at&t
The FCC can just do away with it
There were net neutrality violations then too
The internet has grown spectacularly in these 2 alone.

Not as much as it should
There\xe2\x80\x99s a fucking massive list going from like 2007-now
But way more than without NN
The only companies that violated were these
It\xe2\x80\x99s spectrum
Not that I am aware of
Sause please
Or Comcast.
ISP Monopolies are possible because fucking Title 2.
Have you given more than just the one source today
Why is this so hard to understand
Does this effect it when you use cell data
Heads thicker than bricks
Yes
Yes.
What about vpn\xe2\x80\x99s
Just block the VPN
You dont give any sources
Crap, I was just gonna watch the world burn around me while I just used my phone
So we are slowly turning into china
No?
No.
How
Anti-trust laws could break them up
No
No
Exactly.
No, that\xe2\x80\x99s if the government has control over the internet
Thus is title 2
Those take years to take effect though, as the FTC has a slight issue with responsivity.
No congress handles thay
^
It would take a short hearing
The FTC or FCC sues the company, then Congress handles it
Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the senate/ house vote on net neutrality today
Wrong if it\xe2\x80\x99s Congress I\xe2\x80\x99ll die before anything happens
The FTC has yet to deal in one of these scenarios
David I told you this, yes
FCC does
Anti\xc2\xae Trust\xc2\xa9 Laws\xe2\x84\xa2
Like, even before NN
Sause
Heh,  they are good at hearings, making shit happen is another thing entirely

This was from the previous person talking in this

Congress will not be involved in the vote. It is an FCC regulation. The FCC votes on it.

Net Neutrality Update: Web Inventor Says FCC Does Not Understand How The Internet Works\nTim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web, Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple and a couple of other pioneers of the industry have come forward in order to ask Congress and FCC to cancel their vote on Net Neutrality. The pioneers believe that the repeal is based on flawed and inaccurate data. The following is part of the open letter to the lawmakersAccording to WWW inventor:\xe2\x80\x9cI want an internet where ideas spread because they\xe2\x80\x99re inspiring, not because they chime with the views of telecoms executives. I want an internet where consumers decide what succeeds online, and where ISPs focus on providing the best connectivity.If that\xe2\x80\x99s the internet you want \xe2\x80\x93 act now. Not tomorrow, not next week. Now.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSubmitted by talha21210\nvia reddit http://ift.tt/2AX6Aj1

Has the internet really been free? We\xe2\x80\x99ve had to spend lots of money to Oxford machines that allow us to use it
deals with companies
And?
Yeah all the companies can all raise their prices together to make it so they can all profit and no one will have anywhere to turn because everyone would have raise their prices.

I like him
Why do you not like him
he just fucking creeps me out
pluss i like my internet how it is
why would i have two providers?
ISP....?
Competition?
Why would you NOT want more than one
If anything this gives the big companies a harder time and the smaller ones a chance to grow
What does
The repeal
And people do know this was only put in place two years ago right
Yes
notice: only one person in here agrees with this change
One our of the three that talk
One out of the three that talk
And I doubt anyone here has read the regulations
No slowing traffic was simply a side effect of NN.
so the best thing to do is never mention this to the public, ever
^
and put the most punchable guy as our foreman
They did.
All the news outlets that control what you think just want you to be angry.
I just touched on that.
Net Neutrality is not JUST requiring all traffic to be the same. It is the reclassification of every single ISP, no matter how big or small, to Title 2. Title 2 regulates companies (again, no matter how big or small) as if they are monopoly; now, I don\
In conclusion: The previous Net Neutrality rules did MUCH MORE than give us net neutrality, many of which were detrimental to business and consumers. If you want a tl;dr here it is.\n\nOpen Internet Rules:\n    No Blocking\n    No Throttling\n    No Paid-Prioritization\n\nReplaced with FTC regulations:\n    No monopolies. (lookin at you comcast)\n    No collusion. (still lookin at you)\n    No consumer abuse\n    No unfair business practice. (holy fuck comcast)
Fucking hilarious

predatory selection began to favour foxes that were more useful for sexual relief than for food. wolves would keep menageries of foxes in their dens, using them for recreational copulation during non-mating season for the females. in turn foxes evolved to complement this symbiotic relationship by evolving a 100% efficient metabolism and the capability to survive entirely on nutrients absorbed from wolf semen. \n\nover millions of years, these foxes evolved special pores beneath their fur that allowed them to consume cum through the skin. this works best when the semen is rubbed into them by rolling around in an orgy of wolves and other foxes, leading to their instinctive promiscuity. the anus of the fox is a peculiar structure indeed. without the need for a full digestive track, the vestigial lower intestine became a somewhat shorter section of highly elastic polymer, extracted from the long protein chains found in wolf semen. this allows the colon of the fox to expand in size by a factor of ten while maintaining its tightness and shape. the colon and what remains of the large intestine are still connected to the small intestine in modern foxes but rather than being the end of the digestive tract it acts as a secondary mouth. the large intestine feeds backwards into the small intestine where semen is readily digested without needing to be processed by the stomach.\n\nlike the primary mouth, the lower end of the foxes digestive track has salival glands, though with a different purpose. the anal salival glands of the fox are for lubrication and cleaning out of the colon. this also aids in the conveyance of semen into the small bowel. the modern anthropomorphic fox maintains this symbiotic relationship with wolves to this very day. it is this phenomenon to which we all owe the sexual utility of the fox.

icance, was an attempt made by the french people, in 1793 and 1794, in three different directions more or less akin to socialism. it was, first, the equalization of fortunes, by means of an income tax and succession duties, both heavily progressive, as also by a direct confiscation of the land in order to subdivide it, and by heavy war taxes levied upon the rich only. the second attempt was to introduce a wide national system of rationally established prices of all commodities, for which the real cost of production and moderate trade profits had to be taken into account. the convention worked hard at this scheme, and had nearly completed its work, when reaction took the overhand. and the third was a sort of municipal communism as regards the consumption of some objects of first necessity, bought by the municipalities, and sold by them at cost price.\n\nit was during this remarkable movement, which has never yet been properly studied, that modern socialism was born \u2014 fourierism with l\u2019ange, at lyons, and authoritarian communism with buonarotti, babeuf, and their comrades. and it was immediately after the great revolution that the three great theoretical founders of modern socialism \u2014 fourier, saint simon, and robert owen, as well as godwin (the no-state socialism) \u2014 came forward; while the secret communist societies, originated from those of buonarotti and babeuf, gave their stamp to militant communism for the next fifty years.\n\nto be correct, then, we must say that modern socialism is not yet a hundred years old, and that, for the first half of these hundred years, two nations only, which stood at the head of the industrial movement, i.e. britain and france, took part in its elaboration. both \u2014 bleeding at that time from the terrible wounds inflicted upon them by fifteen years of napoleonic wars, and both enveloped in the great european reaction that had come from the east.\n\nin fact, it was only after the revolution of july, 1830, in france, and the reform movement of 1830\u201332, in england, had shaken off that terrible reaction, that the discussion of socialism became possible for the next sixteen to eighteen years. and it was during those years that the aspirations of fourier, saint simon, and robert owen, worked out by their followers, took a definite shape, and the different schools of socialism which exist nowadays were defined.\n\nin britain, robert owen and his followers worked out their schemes of communist villages, agricultural and industrial at the same time; immense co-operative associations were started for creating with their dividends more communist colonies; and the great consolidated trades\u2019 union was founded \u2014 the forerunner of the labour parties of our days and the international workingmen\u2019s association.\n\nin france, the fourierist consid\xe9rant issued his remarkable manifesto, which contains, beautifully developed, all the theoretical considerations upon the growth of capitalism, which are now described as \u201cscientific socialism.\u201d proudhon worked out his idea of anarchism, and mutualism, without state interference. louis blanc published his organization of labour, which became later on the programme of lassalle, in germany. vidal in france and lorenz stein in germany further developed, in two remarkable works, published in 1846 and 1847 respectively, the theoretical conceptions of considerant; and finally vidal, and especially pecqueur \u2014 the latter in a very elaborate work, as also in a series of reports \u2014 developed in detail the system of collectivism, which he wanted the assembly of 1848 to vote in the shape of laws.\n\nhowever, there is one feature, common to all socialist schemes, of the period, which must be noted. the three great founders of socialism who wrote at the dawn of the nineteenth century were so entranced by the wide horizons which it opened before them, that they looked upon it as a new revelation, and upon themselves as upon the founders of a new religion. socialism had to be a religion, and they had to regulate its march, as the heads of a new church. besides, writing during the period of react

ation has grown more slowly, the increase in production is nevertheless very rapid. notwithstanding the crises through which agriculture is frequently passing, notwithstanding state interference, the blood-tax (conscription), and speculative commerce and finance, the production of wheat in france has increased fourfold, and industrial production more than tenfold, in the course of the last eighty years. in the united states the progress is still more striking. in spite of immigration, or rather precisely because of the influx of surplus european labour, the united states have multiplied their wealth tenfold.\n\nhowever, these figures give yet a very faint idea of what our wealth might become under better conditions. for alongside of the rapid development of our wealth-producing powers we have an overwhelming increase in the ranks of the idlers and middlemen. instead of capital gradually concentrating itself in a few hands, so that it would only be necessary for the community to dispossess a few millionaires and enter upon its lawful heritage \u2014 instead of this socialist forecast proving true, the exact reverse is coming to pass: the swarm of parasites is ever increasing.\n\nin france there are not ten actual producers to every thirty inhabitants. the whole agricultural wealth of the country is the work of less than seven millions of men, and in the two great industries, mining and the textile trade, you will find that the workers number less than two and one-half millions. but the exploiters of labour, how many are they? \u2014 in england (exclusive of scotland and ireland), only one million workers \u2014 men, women, and children \u2014 are employed in all the textile trades, rather more than half a million work the mines, rather less than half a million till the ground, and the statisticians have to exaggerate all the figures in order to establish a maximum of eight million producers to twenty-six million inhabitants. strictly speaking the creators of the goods exported from britain to all the ends of the earth comprise only from six to seven million workers. and what is the sum of the shareholders and middlemen who levy the first fruits of labour from far and near, and heap up unearned gains by thrusting themselves between the producer and the consumer, paying the former not a fifth, nay, not a twentieth, of the price they exact from the latter?\n\nnor is this all. those who withhold capital constantly reduce the output by restraining production. we need not speak of the cartloads of oysters thrown into the sea to prevent a dainty, hitherto reserved for the rich, from becoming a food for the people. we need not speak of the thousand and one luxuries \u2014 stuffs, foods, etc. etc. \u2014 treated after the same fashion as the oysters. it is enough to remember the way in which the production of the most necessary things is limited. legions of miners are ready and willing to dig out coal every day, and send it to those who are shivering with cold; but too often a third, or even two-thirds, of their number are forbidden to work more than three days a week, because, forsooth, the price of coal must be kept up? thousands of weavers are forbidden to work the looms, though their wives and children go in rags, and though three-quarters of the population of europe have no clothing worthy the name.\n\nhundreds of blast-furnaces, thousands of factories periodically stand idle, others only work half-time \u2014 and in every civilized nation there is a permanent population of about two million individuals who ask only for work, but to whom work is denied.\n\nhow gladly would these millions of men set to work to reclaim waste lands, or to transform illcultivated land into fertile fields, rich in harvests! a year of well-directed toil would suffice to multiply fivefold the produce of dry lands in the south of france which now yield only about eight bushels of wheat per acre. but these men, who would be happy to become hardy pioneers in so many branches of wealth-producing activity, must stay their hands because the owners of the soil, the mines, and the factories prefer to

@danny_dan4
i got a bluetooth speaker and when i connect to it. it plays static, but when my dad's phone connects it works perfectly
can anyone help?
theories?  suggestions?
is there any other things that might be making your bluetooth signal weaker than his
idk
like background cell data usage
my headphones perhaps
i'm not even on wifi
waiy
wait
if your phone is multitasking it will likely weaken the signal
why
that makes no sense
because it puts strain on your phone
you'd be surprised.
some phones' resource usage is so bad that things like that occur
mine is one of them.
what
that doesn't
no
that's not how signal strength works
idk how it actually works but usually what i do is close everything else.
and it seems to work most of the time
my phone is doing nothing else
noice
is his a different phone or is it the same phone
it's a galaxy note 3
it's older than mine
older
then idk
he's begging for my cheese on my popcorn
i think i broke it

@rwarpaws debate group is broken
the shitty one with the racists?
literal nazis took over
oh no who knew
i left a while ago
too much stress
i might actually leave
yeah that chat turned into a shit show
my final message to them
well, it only took 3 weeks for this to turn into an echo chamber for racists.
everyone report @notyourechochamber for violence
xd
yep
i should start blaming the jews for all my problems
same
jk
i actually lost the rest of my brain cells
why did you post your address.
because i knew he wouldn't do shit
how do i report, new to reporting things
i am shaking because these people are so fucking dumb
top right three dots
k
conor i see that
conor keep going
you're pissing g them off big time
seff, they are worshiping your face
literally laughing to tears over conor's spam
when the nazis try to counter spam
conor on the offensive
is there another, non stupid debate chat i could join
you see what this fake gangster boy is doing to me right
yep
this fucker
he's legit spamming animal abuse
oh i know
and now i'm getting shit for calling him out
what is wrong with that group
it's nazis
but jesus even adolf would kill himself again if he saw them
adolf hitler was pro animal rights
this isn't very holly jolly of you
look at the chat for a few minutes
i'm fighting this bigot who calls me a fake german, doesn't have any proof, calls me a kraut, but says i'm a fake german
i'd really rather not
another thing you say i'm a fake german, but you then call me a kraut? choose a side italy
i might leave the chat because firstly i need sleep second i'm not in the mood to deal with horrible people rn.
i'm not leaving
they can kick me
i'm not leaving without a fight
the dumbass still has yet to answer any of my questions, but he can ask me loaded questions
i don't blame you
gn i'm done with that bs
same
imma say my peace and go to bed and enjoy my time with family
i'm done with them
good night all
and merry christmas everyone! i hope you all have brilliant days
i love how i ended up learning about this guys family history and how he lives and stuff while they\u2019re over there just screaming nazi
2000 gifs was all it took to hault all debate and start my own convo
merry christmas
merry christmas everyone
i thought this was listing people who would kill themselves again, jesus and adolf
here is sexy kat for a sexy krsms
ew

same
merry christmas

got banned, what's going on in there xd
i told myself never to look at that chat, bit they are talking shit about you
showww
xd
also his ban was way overdue
he ad homs constantly
meh. i find arguing with the stupid impossible
same
guess they need to rename the chat to "your echo chamber"
yep
there is one dude defending you
that l guy?
he wasn't using dumbass to attack your argument
"puresodium is a dumbass but he is right " is not ad hom
xd
well the chats dead, the brainless admin made the salt man an admin
oh shit
yeah no thanks
will quickly become an echo chamber
it already has
now who wants to start a better chat
naaa it will her ruined as fast as its made
naaa it will be ruined as fast as its made
just don't allow salt
no
that's pink
hmm
maybe with an overshirt
that's pink?
meh
it would probably look better if i didn\u2019t look like i fell out of bed after 4 hours of sleep
you know i really wanted a big bird costume for christmas
just so i can do this
just imagine you're going to school they didn't you see big bird riding on a back of a horse laughing at you as you walk into the building
then you see*
and make sure you use your whistle to flip everyone off
yes!!!!
me
i've registered too many public names

The cave itself is tiny in size, yet there is an abundance of bullet fodder. Traveling takes some time and the journey is perilous. Captains, Vandals, a wizard, knight and Thralls that could very well number into the 1000s stand in your way; yet it is worth the trek. Also finally realizing that you can run past all of them makes it far easier. Being the first to arrive. Will others come? Perhaps. Only time will tell. Fellow guardians finally begin to show. 1, then 2,3,4, and finally the fifth.

If you want an accurate measure of the speed you're getting, you need to use a test that's not affiliated with your ISP, and do it several times at different times of day and week.

Sex isn't sinful.I disagree with it in much the same way that I would disagree with a straight guy running around in thongs slapping people with fleshlightsNobody is being slappedlmaoSame difference.you're making a strawmanI made the argument.Strawmans are against arguments.It is my argument I can make it whatever I wantthis.
you're making my points seem ridiculous by bringing up an unrealistic situation.Then remove the word "slapping"https://i.imgur.com/HOF4HeJ.pngOpinion doesn't change.A strawman is just whenever you're attacking something that doesn't really exist or isn't really being argued foralright.
so what would be the limit in your mind?take this somewhere concretecollin plsOkok I'm doneMaybe one moreIn a bitCarry on I was never herenoooo pls stay and talk you're a good talkerThere is an area of decency that the public expects or, I feel, is entitled to. Neither of those situations is something anyone, except for a tiny majority, wants to see. Keep the outside SFW.So what would that imply?
No public nudity or sex toys in public?Are either of them sfw?I'm asking you.SFW is subjectiveIn my opinion? NoI think subjectivity, when we're talking about things like this, mostly mean that there's a grey area. And I'm pretty sure sex toys and nudity are beyond the grey areaDefinitely.Dressing up in your gimp suit and acting like a dog is also outside the gray area. :vPutting on nipple clamps and prancing around schools is also outside the gray areaew emojixDI do not, however, care about public displays of affection. Same rules apply for any couple, regardless of gender.A group will always be judged by its lowest common denominator. Try not to be that denominator.I think the realm of what's socially acceptable in public can and should shift but for now I think it's important for movements looking for mass appeal to make themselves presentable. I see a lot of people on the left or advocating for progressive causes scoff at the idea of presentability politics and honestly I can't fully understand why. I understand not wanting to sacrifice the beliefs of your movement, but associating "gay pride" with "men in rainbow thongs in a parade" in the public mind isn't going to help your causeOn New Years Eve, every single adult in the world will have been born in the 20th century and every child will have been born in the 21st century, and thats the only day thats true for.ExactlyAlright, I can see what you mean
However, I personally disagree.
On the nudity point.
For one, I don't think nudity is inherently sexual. It's the human body.
It can (and has been in many, many places) been entirely dissasociated with sex.
But that's off-topic, this *is* a sexual argument.

Sex, imo, shouldn't be seen as sinful as it is in popular culture. It's, just as with nudity, perfectly natural. Sex toys, BDSM gear, whatever you want to talk about. It's just objects, and the idea of it "spoiling children" or something by exposing them to adult concepts is, in my eyes, kind of ridiculous. We have the internet for that lmao(That's my current stance but I'd readily hear any argument against presentability politics)My 5 year old nephew is already talking about stuffing his face in his future girlfriends ass and tits.

Something is inheritly wrong with that, in my opinion.Children don't have the mental capacity to understand such subjects, nor the full weight of what performing them entails.(Finally, perfection. Thanks @MoansAnnoyingly)(Finally, perfection. Thanks @SallyManDur)I understand what it comes from.
But, to me, this is coming from a place deeper than "ideological purity" or whatever. 
More a philosophical antipathy towards legislation on the sole basis of "that's how it's always been" or "it's sinful"The problem? Nudity IS SEXUAL in this culture. I never said it was a sin, by the way.wasn't implying you were, just one of the most common arguments?I'm not saying kids can consent to sex or anything, at all.But look at the prevelance of violence in American cultureThat message wan't about consentThat message wasn't about consentAh okwhat I mean is that hiding something from a child's view isn't going to "protect" them from it.Best way to get it through is education.Well yeah. But from a purely practical standpoint, Seff's hypothetical dildo smacking pridesman is only going to make people think being gay is gross and bad and ultimately hinder the movement. I agree with hating traditionalism and arbitrary dogmatic morality, but presentability isn't succumbing to those, it's just what you have to do to winThey don't understand the legitimate weight of sexual actions. If you make it commonplace, it is my belief that the age at which people reproduce will lower. Drastically.And that, in my opinion, isn't a good thingGotta draw the line somewhereKids know about sex
Kids have known about sex and how it works since like age seven for damn near ever:PDo you thoughInternet, again
Before that it was porno mags, or whispers in the back of a classroom.My nephew was 4 when he started talking about itDrawing lines is what produces society. It is what keeps things civil.Actually, as education about sex goes up, the level of teen pregnancies goes down.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3194801/I'm more willing to point that towards the "free condoms for all" thing.I'm more willing to correlate that towards the "free condoms for all" thing.That's part of sex edWhat's up fuckersoh hey bucksI'm the dud who keeps making these new pfpsTalking about sex with childrennoxDgod dammitI need to make this taller tbhSorry, talking about sex AND childrenMehtalking about talking to children about sexOriginally talking about gay people running around the streets with thongs and dildosThe study linked controlled for thati'm bad at going deeper than the abstract oopsI just scrolled and looked at relevant headings :PI read that, look through graphs, and link
i'm a dumbhead lmaoWith things that say _ is linked to _ I'm always worried they might be ignoring some third factor or that they aren't actually related, so I looked deeper at what other variables were accounted for. Income, planned family checks, ethnic composition, and... something else I forget were all controlled for and found to not have a significant impactWoof~my dogs when the mail man came byExplain thisFinal edit= tallerOfficially finally done changing the photo+1WAIT SHIT I GOTTA FIX SOMWTHINWAIT SHIT I GOTTA FIX SOMETHINjk .3.So this definitely does seem to suggest that more sex ed means less teen pregnancy*steals you* make me pixel artSo more exposure to sex = less people having sexBut it has to be done correctly, if you just teach them about sex theyll do it. If you teach them to wait theyll wait some timessometimesAbstinence doesn't work thoTheres always gonna be that one couple in the bathroom at home comingSo... disprovedhomecummingI believe your argument is valid, but it's missing the actually methodology.

I say you teach kids how much parenthood costs average objectively, financially and time-wise, and then teach them about contraceptive measures.I believe your argument is valid, but it's missing the actually methodology.

I say that the best way to teach kids to wait to have sex is that you teach kids how much parenthood costs average objectively, financially and time-wise, and then teach them about contraceptive measures.True trueI always say start with a petI say only have petsIf you cant raise a pet you cant have a kid^"Don't Stay In School" had a great lyric:

"All this talk about using a condom, but nothing about having a child when you want one."teach them to use freakin condoms Parents: when are we gonna get a grandchild? 

Me: you mean grand puppy?lmaoI agree but that statement is empty.im not gonna teach an 8 year old how to use condoms+1Just first make it clear that parenthood is a big responsibility early on, then in high school you can teach them about contraceptive methods.Then you can only expect them to have sex without them \_()_/...thismaybe *you* won't

all seriousness this is kinda tertiary
most pre-pubescents aren't going to have sex???and teaching someone that something exists doesn't mean they're going to do it+1+1What ever happened to good old flower sack babys?That's not true. By the time they're in Middle School they're already experimenting and I believe this is the result of a failure on the education to teach kids the responsibility of parenthood.I don't think children should be sexualized. I believe teaching <13 how to use condoms is way too early+1it's not about sexualizing children
it's about trying to hide sexualized things for fear of children seeing itnothat's what I'm on about
idk if you are I guess :P/help@GroupButler_bot/ see it as sexualizing children.Nice counterthesis no uDo you guys believe teaching kids at a very early age the responsibilities of parenthood is a good idea, or at least better than just teaching them to not have sex?YesDo you guys believe teaching kids at a very early age the responsibilities of parenthood is a good idea, or at least better than just teaching them the dangers of sex?Teach them the penalties firstYespre-puberty is probably unneccesaryimo at least which is what im saying?Late middle school early high school is a good age eight?Late middle school early high school is a good age right?From my town we kinda start learning this shit from the cool guys and girls in fifth grade at the earliest lmao+1YayaYayaYeah 5th grade they show you a movie about puberty5th-6th grade is the standard I think?
anyways I think we're agreeing on sex ed stuff so this is a bit of a moot pointPuberty is 5th grade, they shouldnt talk about sex till early high schoolBy sex I mean parenthoodwhat I've been tryna say is that if a kid sees a tit in public that's not going to hurt them foreverat my school they started in 5th grade, had a class mandatory in 7th, and also a class you have to take sometime in high school that most people take sophomore-junior year (10th-11th grade)The problem is in our current society, nudity is sexuaMake them do a real world real money kinda thing where they get with a partner one day and they have to go through a sim where they have to manage their money to afford a kid and a house and a carThe problem is in our current society, nudity is sexualThe problem is in our current society nudity is sexualand the way to change that is to stop treating it as suchWhy should we?it's not productive to do soNudity being sexual gives you a special intimacy with your partnerit's unncessesary effort for little gain:vI dont wanna see Mr. Wookiee over there walking around with his furry balls out.Yeahbut isn't that forcing your personal preferences on everyone?
:vWhat he saidIt's restricting+1In your opinioni don't care about nudityI wouldn't be nude in publicbut I don't want to force people to do shit they don't wanna doPublic decencyis inherently subjectiveI respect that you wanna see mr wookie's furry balls in public but most people don'tIt's about personal autonomynot seeing people's assesI fail to see a differencewe're restricting people's rights for tradition's sakethat's what it isand that's why i take issue with itTraditionally we don't like murder. Lets get rid of itInb4 spooooooksthat's a false equivalencyTraditionally people covered themselves... they dont want that exposed to the sun to get burntis people being nude going to hurt anyoneMescarred for life after seeing mr wookieI think this video is relevant but I haven't watched it in a whileI hate to be rude but
grow up sweetie
the world isn't your safe space :3There are nude beaches for that. It should not be a everywhere kinda thinghttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4HGfagANiQThere's a difference between a safe space and common decency.Is there?please lay that out for me>.>I'm interested to see this tooAnd also interested to see how this lies with your opinion regarding trans people and pronounsyou don't have to, I suppose 
but that's just my opinion :>Common decency is a generally respected safe space if you want to be that weird about it.people shouldn't be arrested for misgendering folks or anything but it still makes them an assholeit's intentional disrespectlets not get on the subject of trans people :Valright.
but why should your opinion be taken as the opinion of everyone's?gender dysphoria is a touchy subject.Oh please, tell me why I'm wrong about my life choicesTell me about itpeople shouldn't be arrested for being nude in public or anything but it still makes them an asshole
it's intentional disrespectKeep going that route and im leaving the conversation.xDBut as it is, they are arrested for it.That's the difference.Sure it can be your opinion that they shouldn't do it.
But yours has the force of law.The law is determined by the majority.my opinion is the law. therefore it is the majority.If you're uncomfortable with it, that's cool.
But if you're going to disrespect me for being trans I am going to press the topic.If you're uncomfortable with it, that's cool.
But if you're going to later disrespect me for being trans I am going to press the topic.And thus oppresses the minorityhow has anything I have said gone the route of being uncomfortableThat... What?
that doesn't really work as an argumentlets not get on the subject of trans people :Vgender dysphoria is a touchy subject.?
You said you didn't want to talk about itPlease calm down, I think he only means that it's tangential to the current topicahhhhhhAnd volatile enough that if we focus on it at all then it will dominate the conversation and we'll never reach any conclusion on our public decency debateAnywhpAnywhoIt's an appeal to democracyOk I misread that then I think
I have a policy to try and get things that will destroy the chat later out of the way as soon as possible but
A bit too quick on the gunNo I meant like it didn't make much logical sensethe majority doesn't determine the laws and there is no real indication that that was the majority opinion anywaysIt is the law to not be nude in public. I believe the same. Therefore my opinion is the majority opinion.The majority does, actually.This is a debate chat after allTrans people are mentally ill and they should seek medical helpWe are not talking about that right now thank you.Just like schizophrenia patientsNot now thank you very muchI mean he's not wrong but you don't need to be a dick about it :vI mean you're not wrong but you don't need to be a dick about it :vAlright
But again, my whole argument is that it is not detrimental to anyone's health and thus it banning it is similar to banning homosexuality imonot even remotelyI didn't insult anyone though? Was just saying factsThink he's talking to me actuallyboth?2 things
1. They do, the only accepted medical procedure is transition
2. Sorry for the retort but that's not the topicHow so?That is not incorrectBecause what a homosexual does in his own house is different than people running around outside nude.Most people aren't gay and didn't like gay people back in.. say, the 80'sI will say again.
Nobody is being hurt by nudity.Because it's illegal to do in public?It is now legal in dozens of citieslemme get some statsIt is inprovable therefore not an argument"In many countries public nudity is forbidden outright on the basis that nudity is inherently sexual. Many states of the United States fine offenders on that basissee Indecent exposure in the United States.[5] In Arkansas, not only is nudism illegal (even on private property), it is a crime to "promote" or "advocate" (i.e. express a favorable opinion about) nudism.[6] In many contexts, public nudity has been more accepted, especially at designated areas such as nude beaches and, even in the United States, e.g. during World Naked Bike Ride events or Bay to Breakers. In some states, such as Oregon, public nudity is legal and protected as free speech, as long as there is not the "intent to arouse". In the United Kingdom nudity per se is not unlawful, but the circumstances surrounding particular episodes of nudity may create public order offences, according to a police spokesman in July 2013.[7] After repeated arrest, prosecution, conviction in Great Britain, the activist Stephen Gough sued at the European Court of Human Rights for his right to be nude in public outside of designated areas (like nude hiking). Gough's case concerned only charges brought against him in Scotland. The ECHR rejected his complaint in October 2014,[8] stating that authorities in Scotland had not "unjustifiably interfered with his exercise of freedom of expression", though they did admit that the "acceptance of public nudity in a modern society is a matter of public interest".[9][10]"^Same with homosexualityYou can't prove it's not hurting anyonewhy not ban it?Again, there's a difference between two guys fucking in their house and everyone running around nude in publicYou're arguing disingenuouslyCan't prove that can you...Nothing to proveOne is not in public, one is in public.One doesn't come in contact with other people's lives, the other affects everyone who sees them.This track is kind of pointless and neither of us are proving anything 
I'm looking at lawsDid I not just prove they were different?:Prelating to whether it should be illegal..In the current social climate nudity is sexual. That will likely never change.why?oopsI meant to delete thathttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_nuditythis is giving me better points against iti.e. rape survivors who are affected by nuditythe point about pride parades was moot oops
they get ordinances and post if there is going to be nudity or sexual content in the paradeI feel like I've argued for nothing for near an hour lmao so imma switch gears to a spicer one if no one objectsI agree, this argument has pretty much hit a wall where both sides wont agree and theres no changing that.it's kind of entirely an opinion-based point over whether it should or shouldn'tit's kind of entirely an opinion-based point over whether it should or shouldn't be a thingand as it is most everywhere laws are entirely subjective to what courts see as "publicly indecent"I see both sides, I think there should be areas where its legal but I dont want to have someone naked walking around a restaurantNude beaches are ok. A naked street vender whos selling food, not ok with me.Off topic real quick but should I get terraria for $5?So lets change the subject after you send thatanyways I'm super-well versed in trans issues and the medical procedures behind current treatment and the philosophy thereof
the *only* accepted treatment to persistant dysphoria is transition. Which can mean just pronouns, or getting hormone therapy, or even (rather rarely) surguries etc
it is (probably? neuroscience is still looking into it but there have been promising studies) a structural issue inside the brain that causes the brain to, more or less, resemble the structure of the identified gender as opposed to the assigned oneit was a different topic anyways ;Pthough I kinda agree, after thinking it overstarbound's (imo) better if the price is around thatStar bound is $10oof

@DJM011602Btw wtf I thought @rwarPaws and @ExactZer0 disliked each otherI don't see much reason for thatIm just asking questions\_()_/Im not actually gonna do anything unless people see a problemAlso stupid question... why 5 warns?AhProbably for stupid reasonIt's seems arbitrary5 seems like a lot but then again people can get heated and say something they dont meanThere seems to be a lot of overlap between this and Buckos chatThat's a valid perspective on the matter I thinkXDThat's tru!5 warnings lets us be more strict in what does/doesn't warrant oneThat memory thoughMore chances = greater time to understand how one gets warned?I see thatMore chances = we can warn you for smaller things without worrying about it being so close to a kickOh so like 1 warn for a minor offense and like 2 for a big one?Could do thatBut like. Calling someone stupid 3 times, while it is against the rules and should get 3 warns, doesn't seem like it should be a ban to meTruePeople I know in this chat:

If only I was an average gay dudeI wish I was a good personI just added a 7th rule that I figured might be needed.NiceI mean, I'm not delicate :P
It's often genuine misunderstandingI was a bit of an asshole up there tbhWho the hell would shun someone for being a scitzoNyoThis thoight is painNyoNoWhere?Where is this 7th rule????????No bigotryWhere is it posted?/rules?Rip brbI feel number 7 needs to be no bigotry, period.The pinEven if you can change something about yourself that people don't like, that doesn't warrant those people to treat you with bigotry.

For example, even if there's a nazi around the corner, approaching them as if they're below human because of their ideology is, imo, horrendous.Pinned messageNow if they first treat you like an unequal peer, then you can treat them likewise.;-; it only has 6 for me@rwarPaws does really good job at this IRL/rulesI think the first instance was this unreasonable girl name Zoey, amiright @rwarPaws?I've done some thing greatI mean being a nazi instantly places basically everyone as not being an equal peerOf course, they weren't a Nazi, but they were definitely emotionally abusive and irrational.Zoey...?In thought, but not in speech or action by default. When someone says they're a Nazi, they haven't given a purpose a wound from their words.I don't remember this :/Micah's now-exIn thought, but not in speech or action by default. When someone says they're a Nazi, they haven't given a purpose a wound solely from their words.O yea forgot about thatAnd Jess...Micah's other ex lolYeayeaI mean we both agree on that and this is a public chat where not everyone knows about Micah's love lifeIt is pinned+1"They haven't given a purpose a wound solely from their words"
Sorry what?But it only has 6 for meFuck autocorrectNot our fault \_()_/In thought, but not in speech or action by default. When someone says they're a Nazi, they haven't made a wound solely from their words.EditedLol/help@GroupButler_bot/help@GroupButler_botAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAXDHonestly its the same thing as putting anything else into the public eye, people will get pissed about itA fantastic example is westboro Baptist and how they make every other Christian look>god hates gays, masturbators, and also soldiers

Way to hate 95% of the population, guys. You'd probably get along with isisIt reinforces that groups beliefs, is what it doesWhy does it matter if it's in a spoken thought vs in speech? Saying "I'm a nazi" can pretty much be replaced by its ideological principles. In the same way "I'm an anarchist" means "I want to abolish the state," "I am a Nazi" means "I think Jews are lesser people and should be treated as such." By saying they are a Nazi (in other words that they hate jews) they have treated them as unequal peers, and by your own logic this gives Jews (and anyone else (everyone) the Nazis think are lesser people) to reciprocate that unequal treatmentYes, but that's not even close to a good reason to be a bigot to them off the bat.Believe it or not, a lot of Nazis aren't truly convinced of their ideology and just roll with whateverActual Nazis don't think Jews are lesser people, but instead rather schemey in a smart way/configIE Hitler blamed poverty on jewsDue to banks and the likeYou act like someone who goes by a label will always fully know and understand what that label entails.And many Nazis believe this as wellTHISYe?Yep

So, do y'all wanna debate about something.NoI know what you are thinkingYou know it pisses me offDont say itWhatIs water wet?Not individuallyYes.NiceEnd of story.Time to find my essayWater isn't wet nor is it dry^Water's wetWet means covered in waterWater does cover itselfAs long as you have more than a single molecule"Wetness is our description of what we feel when we put our hand in water. Saying water is wet is like saying that wood is hard or fire is hot. A combination of temperature, pressure and the way water moves tells our brain that water is wet." ~Planet ScienceBut it is still part of the same body of water. My personal definition of wet is a body of something covered in a liquid. How can a body of something be covered in itself.Sensing something is wet is part of our sensesUsing that definition, does lava make things wet? It is a liquid after allMaybe, I don't want to test it because I prefer to stay aliveDoes molasses make things wet?Does tar?Both of these are by definition liquidYes, those are both make things wet. I've had the pleasure of trying to clean those out of woodDoes mercury for that matter make things wetIt doesn't, no mercury residue is left behind therefor it doesn't make things weyIt doesn't, no mercury residue is left behind therefor it doesn't make things wethttp://m.nautil.us/issue/25/water/ingenious-richard-saykallyGl out debating me, I'm a lord at debating and I've got experience  from Model UNThis got really intenseNo. Wet indicates it can be dried. Wet implies an alterable condition , compared to being dry. Being wet implies something is covered in water, thus the item is wet^We are all over simplifying waterWater in reality is one of the most complex and confusing molecules there is in chemistryWater contains waterAnd water is a liquidBut that's WikipediaSo if water contains water(a liquid)Therefor it is wetAka. Easily wrongHave you ever read anything on Wikipedia? Wikipedia is actually incredibly accurateCan we all agree on something that Wikipedia isnt a very reliable sourceWell here's a different sourcea wet nurseNiceIt's one of many definitionsBut I have proved, that by definition, water is wetDo any wish to doubt?Technically yesIt can be driedAnd your response to my textbook definition saying water is wet?If something can be dried and its not currently dry, it falls under the definition of wetWater can not be driedThusWater cannot be wetBut water makes things wetIt depends on what your definition of wet isUnder some definitions that is trueBut under others that is falseWho is czar commieIts evaporated into gasBecause he voted in the poll but I don't see him in the member listAnd a solidThat tooDepends on the situationWater is wetNo its dryIt is not. Water is water. It cannot be dried, THUS it is not wet.*it'sNo its waterWhen you touch it, it makes your hand wetWater is waterBut the water remains the same.Throw a towel at water? Water goes into the towel, making it wet.A state of wetness occurs when a liquid reacts with something else but the wetness is in the non liquid that is touching it.But something is wet when it contains volatile particlesAnd what's the definition of volatileAnd does water easily evaporate at normal temperatures?Yes, yes it doesAnd to quoteWater is waterAnd water is volatileAnd of water is waterAnd if water is waterAnd if water is volatileThen water, by definition, is wetIf you are using the definition that something is wet when the contains volatile particlesIs water wetIf you were to read that full article you would find that they use a different definition of the word wetGrey or GrayGreySo, bothGrey for EuropeanGray for AmericanDepends on US vs UK/Canada/Australia/New Zealand EnglishI use grey personallyAlthough I'm American and I use greyGrey here tooI use the UK spellingsFor exampleI say specialise instead of specializeI switch randomly between the twoPicking one or the other based on where I am or what is proper seems like an arbitrary restriction on my freedomTHISOr colour vs color^Egoist linguisticsWait... which one have I been using???I use them interchangeablyGet fuckedThe Queens English>>>>>>I use grey apparentlyBecause greyhoundFills a 7/11 big gulpGotta drink it at the endGreyhound is a breed of dog.

Also none of the parts can be replaced because the brand no longer exists.Also thats just a few of my things. I have a set of harmonicas, some ocarina that arent good quality, a guitar and two concert uke, and a piano.

       find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

SYNOPSIS
       find [-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [expression]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents  the GNU version of find.  GNU find searches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-point by evaluating the given expression
       from left to right, according to the rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left hand side is false for and  operations,  true
       for or), at which point find moves on to the next file name.  If no starting-point is specified, `.' is assumed.

       If  you  are  using find in an environment where security is important (for example if you are using it to search directories that are writable by other users), you
       should read the "Security Considerations" chapter of the findutils documentation, which is called Finding Files and  comes  with  findutils.    That  document  also
       includes a lot more detail and discussion than this manual page, so you may find it a more useful source of information.

OPTIONS
       The -H, -L and -P options control the treatment of symbolic links.  Command-line arguments following these are taken to be names of files or directories to be exam
       ined, up to the first argument that begins with -', or the argument (' or `!'.  That argument and any following arguments are taken to be the expression  describ
       ing  what  is  to  be searched for.  If no paths are given, the current directory is used.  If no expression is given, the expression -print is used (but you should
       probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This manual page talks about `options' within the expression list.  These options control the behaviour of find but are specified immediately after  the  last  path
       name.   The  five  `real'  options  -H,  -L,  -P, -D and -O must appear before the first path name, if at all.  A double dash  can also be used to signal that any
       remaining arguments are not options (though ensuring that all start points begin with either ./' or /' is generally safer if you use  wildcards  in  the  list  of
       start points).

       -P     Never  follow symbolic links.  This is the default behaviour.  When find examines or prints information a file, and the file is a symbolic link, the informa
              tion used shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information about files, the information used shall be taken from the properties of the  file  to  which
              the  link points, not from the link itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this
              option implies -noleaf.  If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will still be in effect.  If -L is in effect and find discovers a symbolic link to a  subdi
              rectory during its search, the subdirectory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When  the  -L  option  is  in  effect, the -type predicate will always match against the type of the file that a symbolic link points to rather than the link
              itself (unless the symbolic link is broken).  Actions that can cause symbolic links to become broken while find is executing (for example -delete)  can  give
              rise to confusing behaviour.  Using -L causes the -lname and -ilname predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing the command line arguments.  When find examines or prints information about files, the information used

       for or), at which point find moves on to the next file name.  If no starting-point is specified, `.' is assumed.

       If  you  are  using find in an environment where security is important (for example if you are using it to search directories that are writable by other users), you
       should read the "Security Considerations" chapter of the findutils documentation, which is called Finding Files and  comes  with  findutils.    That  document  also
       includes a lot more detail and discussion than this manual page, so you may find it a more useful source of information.

OPTIONS
       The -H, -L and -P options control the treatment of symbolic links.  Command-line arguments following these are taken to be names of files or directories to be exam
       ined, up to the first argument that begins with -', or the argument (' or `!'.  That argument and any following arguments are taken to be the expression  describ
       ing  what  is  to  be searched for.  If no paths are given, the current directory is used.  If no expression is given, the expression -print is used (but you should
       probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This manual page talks about `options' within the expression list.  These options control the behaviour of find but are specified immediately after  the  last  path
       name.   The  five  `real'  options  -H,  -L,  -P, -D and -O must appear before the first path name, if at all.  A double dash  can also be used to signal that any
       remaining arguments are not options (though ensuring that all start points begin with either ./' or /' is generally safer if you use  wildcards  in  the  list  of
       start points).

       -P     Never  follow symbolic links.  This is the default behaviour.  When find examines or prints information a file, and the file is a symbolic link, the informa
              tion used shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information about files, the information used shall be taken from the properties of the  file  to  which
              the  link points, not from the link itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this
              option implies -noleaf.  If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will still be in effect.  If -L is in effect and find discovers a symbolic link to a  subdi
              rectory during its search, the subdirectory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When  the  -L  option  is  in  effect, the -type predicate will always match against the type of the file that a symbolic link points to rather than the link
              itself (unless the symbolic link is broken).  Actions that can cause symbolic links to become broken while find is executing (for example -delete)  can  give
              rise to confusing behaviour.  Using -L causes the -lname and -ilname predicates always to return false.

SYNOPSIS
       find [-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [expression]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents  the GNU version of find.  GNU find searches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-point by evaluating the given expression
       from left to right, according to the rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left hand side is false for and  operations,  true
       for or), at which point find moves on to the next file name.  If no starting-point is specified, `.' is assumed.

       If  you  are  using find in an environment where security is important (for example if you are using it to search directories that are writable by other users), you
       should read the "Security Considerations" chapter of the findutils documentation, which is called Finding Files and  comes  with  findutils.    That  document  also
       includes a lot more detail and discussion than this manual page, so you may find it a more useful source of information.

OPTIONS
       The -H, -L and -P options control the treatment of symbolic links.  Command-line arguments following these are taken to be names of files or directories to be exam
       ined, up to the first argument that begins with -', or the argument (' or `!'.  That argument and any following arguments are taken to be the expression  describ
       ing  what  is  to  be searched for.  If no paths are given, the current directory is used.  If no expression is given, the expression -print is used (but you should
       probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This manual page talks about `options' within the expression list.  These options control the behaviour of find but are specified immediately after  the  last  path
       name.   The  five  `real'  options  -H,  -L,  -P, -D and -O must appear before the first path name, if at all.  A double dash  can also be used to signal that any
       remaining arguments are not options (though ensuring that all start points begin with either ./' or /' is generally safer if you use  wildcards  in  the  list  of
       start points).

       -P     Never  follow symbolic links.  This is the default behaviour.  When find examines or prints information a file, and the file is a symbolic link, the informa
              tion used shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information about files, the information used shall be taken from the properties of the  file  to  which
              the  link points, not from the link itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this
              option implies -noleaf.  If you later use the -P option, -noleaf will still be in effect.  If -L is in effect and find discovers a symbolic link to a  subdi
              rectory during its search, the subdirectory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When  the  -L  option  is  in  effect, the -type predicate will always match against the type of the file that a symbolic link points to rather than the link
              itself (unless the symbolic link is broken).  Actions that can cause symbolic links to become broken while find is executing (for example -delete)  can  give

One of the results was 70 kiloes.
"You pigs eat too much. Next dozen!"I doubt that anorexia is that much worse, therefore obesity is a bigger problemAt least straighter than youa nazi was weighing jews in a concentration camp. One of the results was 70 kilos.

an apartment fire and explosion
somalis being harassed by ultra-conservative muslims
arson of a mosque

You should still treat them as if they are malelmaooThats what I meant if theyre passing or clearly trying to pass as a woman then treat them as a woman just out of respect at leastWhat if they wear a dress to guilt lesbians into sex with them?Oh yeah, I meant female, not maleWhat, like a reverse trap?I gets itWhat if I treat everyone the same?None of it was directed at you tbf

I still have no idea what that should mean, it's the US the one with the higher rate of violent crime and everything
Also the article is badly sourced and references a Molotov bombing of a mosque while talking about how Somalians are ripping apart Minneapolis and says that you can't tie it to anti-muslim sentiments

It's free speech. Repeated harassment should be the only verbally-related offense.plural is a caseOh right, two thenShut upWell, except disrespecting higher powers like officers to their face.That too, but I meant more like killing a black man just because he's black shouldn't be considered a different crime to killing a black man for no reasonWhat cases do in other languages is done with sentence structure in EnglishHate crimes are more harshly punished.When I was still in Secondary, there was a fight.Exactly and I disagree with thatA white kid beat the shit out of my black friend.The white kid got Racial Abuse charges.Even though race wasn't even slightpy mentioned.Even though race wasn't even slightly mentioned.That's my point, calling them hate crimes opens the door to all kinds of fucky legal stuffI was there the whole time, I didn't hear a single "Nigger!" or anything even closely race-related.you can convey pretty much all possible (and some impossible) ways you can interact with an object in one word in finnishAnd the fight stated because my friend said some fucked up shit about the white kid's mother.And the fight stated because my friend said some fucked up shit about the white kid's mother while she was in hospital.I'd be more okay with it if any interracial crimes were treated the same waylike "with his house too" is one word etcLike how people called to an end to hate speech on Facebook and now people get banned for saying stuff like "kill all men"Oh yeah, Finnish is a fascinating fucking language.Very distinctive too.And I had problems learning Germanremember when the Internet was about free speechIt'd be better, but I still think getting rid of the idea altogether is bestNoI do.YouTube was almost free of regulations.Pepperidge farm remembersExcept basic stuff like porn and drugs.I remember when there was porn on YouTubeThere still is!Dutch has only singular and plural, but a lot of weird conventions that used to be cases that we stopped usingI used to search gay kissing in YouTube and it used to be so big for methere still is, google furry porn SSTVi made foodyou just need special software to access itNo I'm talking like actual legitimate porn, ripped straight from porn sites and since youtube was slow with taking things down, it stayed for a whileYummyIt's just child pornoit is :3Not as bad.Sweethave u seen the video where someone associated going outside with the command "child porn" to his friends dogOh yeah! Good shitNo I mean there's a "corner" on YouTube where Romanians or something upload videos of children and because nobody who gives a fuck searches for Romanian child pornography it stays upyou just say child porn and the dog gets all excitedEastern Europe should just be nuked.What about the guy who almost went to prison for teaching his dog a Nazi salute as a jokeJesus settle downAlso training it to be excited when he said "wanna gas the Jews"he is currently under the court processThey're all bad people. :(That was ridiculous, I can't believe he actually got in any kind of trouble for thatSeriously?!?!Count Dankula, right?Is he still?

Drag Queens are NOT transgender.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^2. That's one person.I think people are referring to the hobby itself not requiring much talent, not the individuals.that's fair enough, but even then, a lot of work does go into it. anyone can throw on a wig and make up, but there's an art form to the prefrorming of drag, and it often is a very hard process.Giving a single case that isn't even related doesn't really help though.Not that I don't agree, but it won't convince people.I guess so, but mostly i guess i'm just frustrated with the lack of progress some people have made on the subject.even in Seattle, there's still so many closed-minded people that just look down on them, and being someone who is interested in perhaps trying it one day when i have more time to myself, that does hurt me, you know?I just don't talk with idiotsI respect that one case won't change, but I just wish people would stop generalizing, that's all. There are some bad queens out there, i'll admit (cough Penny Tration Serena ChaCha Alissa Summers cough)but there's a very large majority of performers who work their asses off only to be looked down upon, and that is why i do bring these things up with you guys. you guys are super cool and amazing people, and i feel safe to talk about these things with you guys.

It's kids being more willing to come forward when they've been sexually abusedWhat's worse:

They tend toward the intersection. Republicans are drifting up and right a bit more with the nationalist wave of trump, so it's really only a slight left/right issue. Other than the progressive/traditional axis not included, which I'd say is where most of the difference is, the republicans just want a bit more deregulation than democratsnoTIL it's been psychologically proven that bronze medal winners are happier than silver medal winners.

The current is the same so the voltage is the only thing that matters. More watts, faster heatingsimple physics, that's how electric boilers workI thought u was output and i was inputBut you also have to take into account the temperature intake of the water, the boiler can get as hot as it wants, but if the water won't take on the heat nothing's gonna get done, so we have to factor in how much water is in said boiler and how many joules will heat up each cm3i mean if you plugged the same boiler in on 2 different voltages sure, but they make different ones in different countries that are the same power with different heating elementsbut those variables won't change hereyou can get the same power boilers hereso the entire argument is invalidRight, so we have to think of how different boiling points water has at different elivations, where exactly is this boiler going to installed?so boilers with exactly the same wattage?See, BunDaddy knows what he's talking aboutThx buddoDallas Boilers clubTea is worth more than the Americastrue, since the Americas consist mostly of dirt.dirt is dirt-cheapIt's a lot of dirt, though.And has mineral wealth inside, though barely any leftfile.sticker=CAADBAADCgEAAt5A-Afp8p4AAQbpnHMCTruetime to plough AfrikaGoing to Britain this summer, I expect to be disappointed in their coffee, tea, beer, gin, and whiskey all.expect also to be disappointed by all of their foodEw dont come to Britain its a shit placeWell it depends where you visitIsle of Man, for tax evasionwhy go to IOMgo to jersey:')Fish'n'chips and english breakfasts are the only bits I like.I want to visit Scilly and GuernseyBritish cuisine is so shitty, they had to import Indians to prepare edible food.furries ruin everything@Hexafoxyesalso i got distracted fixing a paypal thing are we still arguing about tea?WelpHave you even checked your DMsGG*sigh*I do support a lower age of consent but that's ridiculousIndia is the part of Britain with the best foodEver heard of Ireland?Ireland is where I will be most of the time thankfully lol.

Less culture shock as soon as 18 comes aroundnoA 14 year old can consent with a 15 year old but not with a 19 y/oImo :vfile.sticker=CAADAQADxgADpYs2BuH3OutKXhujAgfile.sticker=CAADAQADyAADpYs2BmBa0_xddv3oAgRather than a scary grim reaper, visualize death as a Mother, embracing and picking us up after a hurt; our sleepy heads resting safe on her shoulder as she carries us home after a long day.Currently many states have consent at 16 and majority at 18. Which seems illogical to me because a 17 yo can consent to sex but it's still child pornographyIs this a shower thoughtNo.^This is just random philosophy.Do you have an argument orYeah, that as well I find ridiculousUwUThat's... Entirely too young imo.Less so than consent laws butWhy do I even speak. x-xThen again this whole conversation is opinions so likeTruBc u can(Not the concept; the implementation)But it fills me with regret.Just because they have the education doesnt mean they will be responsible^MehThen again so does living but Im not gonna suddenly stop doing that either.I'd say 18 is a good age. Because high schoolers aren't known for making the best decisions.Again, with close in age as well as free condoms
but free condoms should just be a thingThis asoThis alsoWhy should I pay so you can fuckWhats free?It's not the law in the majority of the worldIt's not for me, for one
And they are going to fuck anywaysNothing is free. Someone is paying for it.And it should beThat's not a good argumentRemember back in the old days where people didnt live past their 20s?YesMan, those were the daysIt was around their 30s and or 40sNot when we were hunters and gatherers and didnt know the difference between edible and poison.I say you shouldn't be able to consent until you can use logic to vote.Well depending on the situationI say you shouldn't be able to consent until you can use logic enough to vote.SameIt's to prevent teenage pregnancies.It *works.*Not my faultNot my problemWhy should I be penalized so you can fuckEconomically and socially it isAs inTeenage pregnancies are bad for the economy and society at largeThen ban teenage pregnancies! :DThey can't go to school
The kids grow up poor 
Etc etcYea rightThe way to do that is condomsIt's far fucking cheaperI don't want to pay for it.There's already children having sex at around that age, and I don't think it makes sense for it to be criminal. It makes this natural behavior something that can ruin your entire life. And that seems more harmful to a teenager's sexual development than a mistakeProvide free contraceptives? Is that the right term?You are already
Distributed condoms means you pay less.Heroin is banned, but people still take itSame goes for thisI don't careMake people be more educated of the risks of teenage pregnancyI mean you can pay more so you're able to have your moralistic bullshit but that's all it isThank youNot moralistic.It's my money not yours:3Again, it's not meNo uYou know what I mean.And again
*you* are being dragged down anyways/ don't careSo you're willing to lose money because you don't like the idea of spending money on someone else?That's entirely counter-logicalYesWell I suppose we've established who's operating on emotions here Not emotional at allVoting laws should be lowerHow so?HeLL NONoI think they should be HIGHERExplain how "i don't care that i'm losing money" is logicalWell then drafting ages should be higherHave you seen high schoolers and their logic...yes?It's the principal of the thing. It's my money and I should choose what I want done with it.I *am* a person and I do operate in societyWhy would you want them making hard decisionsThey have the mental capacity of a rotten basket of onionsAgain, that's emotion-basedNot logic-basedIt is notYou can claim it's not all you like but there's no real basis to thatOh hell no+1Then again isn't that a shower thought?If we used logic then Communism would workYou should not send an 18 year old off to war for a country they cant vote in.But people don't use logickindabutnotreallyThey're going to make mistakes, legal or not. And frankly it's still a natural thing for them to want to have sex and to do it. 

I'd rather have them making legal mistakes, as opposed to being either a) sexually stunted due to fears of legality or b) marked for life as a sex offenderloltake vitamin c, don't yiff strangers without condoms, drink a lot of water and gatorade, follow the 621 rule, and you can pretty much survive any conventionI want the d

No seriously i need vitamin c because it's an emergencyShouldn't we take measures to stop bad mistakes from happening.I drink plenty of Coca Cola and Sprite so if I go I should also be goodlolcoca cola hydrates you way less thoIts like a teacher giving an assignment but saying its not required. Do you think people will take the good option and do it anyway.Pretty much...so you're saying you aren't logical and refuse to beYeah that sums it upIf that's how you want to take that argument surepretty sure it actually dehydrates you moreyes but water is tastelessThey're going to happen either way. It's a biological fact- teenagers are horny, and they're going to act on that. All we can do is educate to make sure they're safe about it and give them access to things that help make it safe. Education should be more comprehensive and finish sooner. Contraceptives should be available to them. And they shouldn't be permanently marked as criminals for natural behavior.How else can it be construedYeah I agree with some of thisMaking it illegal doesn't stop it from happeningYou're refusing the things I say by saying you aren't logicaltheres a beautiful thing called juiceYep thats my pointIt makes it harder thus, less desirableI, personally, don't think the government has any right to use my tax money to buy people condoms.Or deodorantThat eitherBut it would be beneficial to you and the country at large if they didWhy not just wait a few yearsthere's also carbonated beverages 
hell i personally may never afford a suit of any quality anywaysOr anything for that matterSo what? It's not their place or jobWhy not?
It's whatever we, as a society, think it should beIt would be beneficial if taxes were 50% and a car was given to me by the government on my 18th birthdayDoes it mean it should be done? NoYou're refusing real help on the basis of "I don't like it:You're refusing real help on the basis of "I don't like it"That's just counterproductive and frankly kind of dumbJust because you can, doesn't mean you should.He's making a rights based argument- a right to, ah, self determination, freedom of spending, all that. Rights are inherently emotion based and have no real factual basis when closely examined, but we still agree on this vague concept of freedom as a basis for societyBy all means you should
You haven't made any real argument against itA government's job is not to supply for the people.It is to protect the peopleWhy?
You're getting fucked over by thatIt's like allowing yourself to be beaten on the basis of asking for help would be weakNo?Not evenNope. It'll still happen. All you're doing is punishing it when it inevitably does. And you're punishing it by preventing them from ever getting employed pretty much anywhere. You're labeling them a sex offender for life because they wanted to have sex with somebody who wanted to have sex with them and they did it.What do you think a government's job is?The government, as an extension of society, should improve the lives of the most amount of people possibleOtherwise it's... idk
Kinda cruelExperimentation is part of healthy development. Fear is the opposite.Not incorrect. But there are better ways to go about doing that than giving freebies.A government's job, in my eyes, is essentially protection. You aren't teaching people how to protect themselves by giving them free shit, you're only teaching them how to leech off you.Not that i've seen.
And regardless of that, condoms are cheap and improve thousands upon thousands of lives.That's absolutely not true.
People on welfare don't just give up and waste away like that.Welfare is helping those in need.Children don't need condoms.https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/11/20/9764324/welfare-cash-transfer-workIt's not children.1.Are they 18?People under 18 aren't children. That's a hugely simplistic way of looking at things and ignores how brains developSo let's change it to teenagers. Doesn't change my argument.https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/science/colorados-push-against-teenage-pregnancies-is-a-startling-success.htmlHow does that diminish my argument?Teenagers dont NEED to fuck.Therefore they don't NEED condoms.They NEED to not be fucking stupid.https://twitter.com/dub_mutt/status/946396227884716032As you said before.They *are* stupid.That's not going to change.So fix their stupidityWhy not just masturbate, same feeling. Just doesn't make you pregnant.The school system is crapHow would you suggest fixing it?No Child Left Behind was a terrible ideaSo is common core.Agreed and agreedBut neither of those things being stopped will reduce teenage pregnancy.AgreedIn your opinion.^The education system needs to be overhauled.get a suit with 0 qualityThe education system failed themshit tier suit...can you give me a single source that says it wouldso normal clothing?theres only like $200 worth of stuff in a super shitty fursuitor like a halloween costume?

The government shouldn't be forcing them to sell anything.dulce hmm... allures youI forgot about the disgusting nature of profiting off of the pain of others sorryThat's not what it was originally made forSingle payer would help the economy and society at large :3Insurance companies being in the pants of hospitals is the problem$60 for a pair of scissors each time it's used? CmonHey I agree with single payer. As long as I know for a fact that the government isn't getting fucked over with prices.the one thing nearly everyone agrees on at this pointI firmly believe that OC was only put in to place for it to fail.So the next admin could convince everyone to switch to single payer.tbh it's been a long time comingwe've had shit worse than most countries since the 80's(damn you ronald reagan )It Italy it works this way, you get a lot less lmkids being accused of being child molesters because they are 18 and they gfs 17, makes a lot more sense IMHOin most U.S. states it does toonot down to the age of 14 butclose-in-age laws are the normWe have the Romeo and Juliet lawsNo here it's down to 14 if the other partner has less then 3 years differenceIf one turns 18 after you're already together it's not illegalIt genuinely saddens me that I could be a neurosurgeon in the UK and make 1/5th of feks income while he is working minimal hours from home and I'd be on 80hr weeksStill leaves a few loopholes but better than nothingoh huh
that's basically what i've been thinking of as a model

i think 3 years is... pushing itprobably 2 imo but that's just opinionNah, kids gonna be kidsKeep in mind that the majority is going towards game development."probably 2 in my opinion but that's just opinion" :Pa 17 year old and a 14 year old is a bit creepyyeahbut again, just opinionAlso what are you going to do, arrest young idiots for being young idiots? Doesn't solve the problemYesyeah lmaoStill thosending kids to jail for having sex is likeThere's also a lot of social pressure against these things usuallywhat the fuck are you doingthat's goodI mean it's illegalso likeyeahillegality =! immorality:/"Minimal hours"You can't really know.So?It's illegaldoesn't make it *wrong*, just a bad ideaHe says he does 6hr days working from home when I spoke to him iircIllegal isn't wrong now?wewIt never wasWeekends off?That's why we talk about whether or not things should be legali mean
seeing as the laws vary between countries
saying something is immoral because it's illegal is a strange thing to doIf it is illegal to be eterosexual, is it wrong to be eterosexual?Yea but sometimes he does art through em bc he enjoys itIllegallity means it's wrong in the eyes of the government.Notice the use of the word wrongIf it is illegal to eat vegetables, is it wrong to eat vegetables?Yesit should be immoral because it hurts people, not because a court decided it wasThis kind of legalism bends my mindi'm using wrong in the sense of immoralSome people get more money in a single month than we'll see in our entire collective lives for kicking balls.not in the sense of a bad ideafile.sticker=CAADAgADVgEAAuE14wgGIHzTr-YddQIIf you don't like the laws: change it.At least Fek has some intellect behind his rich-ish ass.Doesn't make them rightbecause that's so fucking easy am i rightYeaSlavery isn't right because it's legal^Doesn't mean you won't go to jail for itHe just Hurts more bc I've been in a chat with him lolThe Holocaust was litteraly legal under the German legal frameworkagain
immoral =! a bad ideaThe concept of morality is a shamWho said anything about that?i'm using morality as in "it harms more people than it hurts"fuckIt is subjectivei'm using morality as in "it harms more people than it helps"So is tasteI'm looking to make 1/16-1/8th of what he does despite incredible intellectBut at least I won't be working macciesI feel like these being opinions is to be assumed and pointing that out is not productiveDoesn't make it fundamentally uselessBut yeah, there's the cut that Patreon takes then the amount he actually takes home.Yeah, I thought this was a givenyeaEven patreon make more off him than I ever willTechnically, no.After RACK is released for free, he'll lose all of his patrons.It'll go on for a few more years at most.LolAfter RACK is released for free, he'll lose almist] all of his patrons.After RACK is released for free, he'll lose almost all of his patrons.I might just bin off job satisfaction and find something I don't enjoy that pays wellI started a business and had like no money for the first 2 years until it took offAlso, Neurological Surgeons make a shitload of money. At least in the US.Not in the ukI don't see law as an expression of morality, it should be a practical implementation of the ideals and values we desire to have in our society, a way to create a place in which we feel safe to be and to live
Morality is personal, we use politics to try and find the things that we agree can make us better offJust move to the US, the median starting salary there is like 400K.You make 80k for 80hrsMoney my friend98l.98k.Salary also grows with experience.80kTops out at 100I really wanna come to the USABut Im far far too poorSpecially as I can't get loans if I go therrExcuse me while I..Get Rack 2.Honestly I might just gamble on lack of automation and go down accountancy with scope to own firmSeems the only way I can make a big wageAnd seems kinda funAlso keep in mind that 80k is still a lot of fucking money.YesAverage income for a full-time employee is 27k.But for 80hr weeks?not a fair trade offYes, fair.You earn more, you work more.Especially not when it takes 5years uni and 10-12 years in work trainingWhat's the point in having money with no time to enjoy it/setrules

"Femboy" is a delusion, a made-up word that these mid-teens think is real, and have begun calling themselves that to get attention. 
There's twinks, and there's traps. There's no magical unicorn "femboy" in between. Ever notice how people start grasping at straws and changing the definition of what a "femboy" is whenever their existance is challenged, and how everybody's definition of what a "femboy" is, is different? That's proof enough that it's made-up. "Femboy" is a gross, abused, and completely fake term, and so-called "femboys" are the culmination of some of the worst things about attention-starved teenagers combined. No-personality, all-slut, cookie-cutter garbage, who got the choice between "twink" or "trap", but chose both instead, like the spoiled brats they are.Either way it turns me onSo my glutes are gonna be looking fineOwOfile.sticker=CAADAQADcwADk15hEDg59KIpHVHRAgYou faggots are forgetting the way you should prove your dominance as the superior gayhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZpXoxpnWdsI can tell you dont like femboysThis is howI thought femboy and twinkwe were the same thingI thought femboy and twink were the same thingNopePmHuffOr dontSee if i care*cry(*cry*CAN YOU CRUSH MY HEAD WITH THOSE THIGHS MOMSure thing kiddoBeautiful hips~Thanks boiYou're welcome~file.sticker=CAADAQAD2gQAAmE8yAfW_lMI5lh50AIIs that Michael JacksonMhmYisStopeeh heefile.sticker=CAADAQADLy4AAq8ZYgfCe7fwsE1IeQILooooooolfile.sticker=CAADAQADgTwAAq8ZYgd1Wd1cmhefkQIfile.sticker=CAADAQADLi4AAq8ZYgeWXlRfLCGxsQIPlot twist: he's gayHAHGAYI'm the gayFags should dirFags should dieYes, cigarettes are an unhealthy habitGit on outta bere ya britdagGit on outta bere ya britfagMate I'll fucking stab youWith my cock uwufile.sticker=CAADAQAD7QQAAmE8yAccPLbKWhH8PgIcurb stomp itYou're so gay and you don't even like boys no you don't even like boyz^I got 30 kazoos from ChinaWhynow I can be the kazoo kid...Im sorry son but your a disappointmentDieActually dieWhy did you do thisalso got a new jew harpKazoos shorten your life expectancy more than cigarettesI do bothNamely because I'll snap your neck if you play em near meWhyjust to annoy youfile.sticker=CAADAQADeAADg0TEB3zEnvfdXl6eAgI mean I have the odd tin of cigars but never cigarettesaren't you 16 or something17LolBut you can't beat aged scotch and a cigardootIt's ok your daily grapefart intake cleanses your lungsWhat happens if you Grapefart through a kazooI haven't had Hexa fart in my face in forever.BootDamn.

Well, you can have a idea of how correctly translate it :P

The Hispanics have the same problem with English, by that we use the English words in some casesProbably not the same way Spanish speakers would pronounce "cajon" but stillCrawfish is the bestIts a shame its only a louisiana thinggo there and tell them they're doing it wrong lmaoive never actually had themNow that I saw...

if anyone on earth is right, it's going to be scientistsI agree with seff here, this has happened before and will happen again. Its part of nature and with the data we have now its not certain what is actually causing it.the earth *might* explode tomorrowLmaoo. Was it yiff or somethingGo commit UwUicideNah no NSFWOk Ill grab my popcorn brbI do agree that it's happening, and I also agree we aren't helping the situation95% probablity and the scientific community overwhelmingly agreesDang. Thats still funny tho"The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely (greater than 95 percent probability) to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia.1"But I still am not 100% convinced. More like.. 80%you're not an expert tho:/I agree we are adding to it but its also naturalYeah but if they're going to get anything done they need to fully convince everyonenot to say that you can't have an opinion
just that people who have spent their entire lives studying this all agree that it is happening and it is extremely seriousWe are just bringing making it raise a little fasterOh god damn it -_-You must prove they're gay to the Russian Government.Remove my basic human rights daddyusually it *would* cycle back to an ice age
hell, it might still
but I don't recall ice ages being all that hospitible in the first placeHold on does this make sense I dont remember what it was supposed to say and it looks weird...the most significant danger is that the ice caps are melting, which i'm sure has been shoved in your face constantlyholy shit dude.Are they?I've seen contradictory datawell, statistically yeshttps://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/https://xkcd.com/1732/Paint them blackWell the heat rising and falling is most likely due to our orbit with the sun, dont remember where I found that but it seems reasonable. And if Ice ages arent normally hospital I guess now with the heightened heat we will be able to better survive it...that's not exactly how that worksYeah not really correctfrom nasa's kid page on it lmaoHaha fuck FloridaoofShhh I didnt say anything. I obviously dont know anythingY'all motherfuckers need Buddhasome of our largest population centres would be completely sunkMhmIsnt that normal though? The shape of the earth is constantly changing.Buddha needs furriesWell not shape of the earth but the layoutnot at this rate
we haven't got time to prepare for itmissed bangladeshWe should work on making floating cities on artificial islandsthe easier solution is reducing carbon dioxide outputBut that would take lots of time and cooperation between nations that might not get along and even then the temp would still rise because its at that point of the cycle.It could help but its not the only way to fix itWhat if we're in a temporary spike, hm?well, seeing as the scientific consensus is that it's artificially producedwe aren'tCan't say that for a factnor can you say that norway existsit's the best damn info we haveNorway exists thoI think we should go more geeen because I like nature and think it should be preserved but I also think now would be a great time to advance out technologies to be able to prepare if going green isnt fast enoughprove itwithout any doubt whatsoever prove norway exists*puts you in a cage*oh dear we're into philosophy nowam i real?I'm just saying, everyone is freaking out and honestly nobody knows for certain.

Dick is same as height: 14ft. Dick starts at 7ft above ground. Now total height is 21ft. Dick = height, so dick is 21 ft.

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your grandfather put us through. I agreed. At 29, I have never touched a cigarette.

Me:You always seemed like the far right typeQuote of the dayFuck my gay assSureLmaoLit*throws catnip*Many of you out there probably believe fidget spinners are just a toy for kids. You don't know how fucking wrong you are. Fidget spinners were designed for elite athletes, CEOs, and arch-bishops. Kids merely adopted the spinning, we were born in it, moulded by it. I've dedicated my life to fidget spinners. I'm the only truly certified grand master of fidget spinners; 3 time defending world champion WWE belt holder of fidget spinning. So I believe I'm the only one truly qualified to tell you that fidget spinning is a man's sport, a man's man's sport. I was once a boy who became a man thanks to fidget spinning and also natural ageing. Do you wanna know the difference between me and a child? I'm 22 fucking years old, children are usually under 12 depending on what criteria you're gonna use to classify someone as a child so think about that shit next time you see me torpedoing down a slip-and-slide sailing at an atom splitting 68 miles per hour going straight into a fucking brick wall of manliness. How do I stay in top physical form becoming this athletic specimen that scientists can't even fully understand? Well it's all thanks to my work out and diet regimen now it'd make even LeBron James shit his pants. I wake up at 4 am everyday , I drink 3 raw eggs with the side of pancakes with nails sprinkled on top and also a glass of straight uranium, I then grab my favourite fidget spinner: the triple XL gold-plated 25 pound weighted Air-Cutter supreme-extreme maximum turbo overdrive spagooter with pump-action assault-grip as well as extended magazines and a silencer, I've even customised this bad boy with a laser dot sight with a green finish as well as further modifications including hydraulics, 3D printing capability as well as doubling as a fax machine. This is a gadget straight out of MI6, this is right brewed up from fucking Q laboratories- he used to make gadgets for 007 now he's making fidget spinners for me. Do you still think this is a fad for kids you fucking troglodyte? Well I guess if that's how you wanna spin this story, but for me I know the truth, I know that this game was made for men and I've mastered it. I live and breathe fidget spinning.

The other 1% is rainbows.I go to a Catholic school and damn, people be losing their virginity so fastThat 1% kept you goingMy school celebrates lgbtq+ rights thoughReally?Even though it's CatholicYup, had an LGBT day too and there's flags everywhereThey had talks saying support people and don't be rude because they're not different they're happyI'm made of 40% hate, 30% computer, 20% gay and 10% animal noisesNo I was told by my parents to turn off the lights and tv and everything before going up to bed. So I did that and then the kids woke up when I went up the stairs, weirdly enough they slept through my almost flipping the couch because of the dog not getting up and putting too much weight on the footrest of the least balanced side.isn't that all gayCatholic institutions are super gay these daysWell, it's privately run so they figured "why the fuck not" and now they're supporting people even the local cathedralIt's really fucking weird, probably due to the same sex marriage referendum here in 2015Wow, my school taught us that we need to tell gay people to be celibate and ask for God's forgiveness, but be nice about itIs that while guys were fucking one another in the bathrooms?If there's gay stuff happening behind the scenes I haven't been invited. I get some casual flirting with the few gay/bi guys in the theater department.Theater is our refugeIt's also why I even went to this school, the performing arts program is amazingI'm in my last year of school and oh boy, it's been hell. Let's just say it's gonna be better when I'm doneIt's worth the homophobiaHaha, sameWe don't have stuff like that here, we do have a theatre thoughLol my school assumes everyone likes girls but little do they knowI ate lingonberries all day and now my farts actually fucking smell like grapefartsI don't think religious institutions go the right way about being gay. I mean yeah, it's bad according to the Bible but isn't that just the act of gay? Loving another of the same sex is not what the church is against, it's acting upon itWhich I mean.. most do anyway so we're all going to hellThat's why my school teaches that you should just be celibate foreverThe easy solution to that conundrum is to convert to a religion that doesn't careWhat I didBut they don't teach us never to eat shellfish and our uniforms have mixed fibers soooooooooI mean I'm agnostic anyway so religion isn't a huge thing for meThat's pretty gatThat's pretty gauThat's pretty gayI'm a pagan fuck, it's funI think catholicism should be conservative. There are plenty of other religions like lutheranism that aren't as conservative, and it's good to have choices.Oh hey, Irish people used to be pagans. I blame St Patrick for bringing the church hereMy school has a lot of atheists, me included. It's ironic reallyI've never really thought about other religionsEveryone just does their own thing in my school. Deep down they don't really give a fuck if you're getting drilled by a guy or giving it to a girl. Quite frankly, it's none of their business if I'm gay or notRelatableoh fuck I am an adultThis mildly disturbs neThis mildly disturbs mewatwhen you and your buddy are having a banter in the furry chat and people try to join in and it causes a shitstorm between othersThe problem with that though is that like, 99% of people are just the religion they were born into when they're young and it gives queer youth a lot of internalized hate. Other than that Catholicism can be conservative all it wantsI'm sorry but what the hell is this tide pods memeLol I was born a R.C. but not once have I gone to mass other than communion, confirmation and christeningscan confirm, and tbh internalized hate isn't because I'm gay, my household isn't hard line christianTbh the only thing I got out of my catholic upbringing was a cool second middle nameI came out to a few friends and they seemed shocked and first but then didn't care. I know a good few gay guys in my school and being in a male only school just makes it worse, you can almost sense the testosterone flowing through the airSaaame, and I'm not against religions or anything it's just..  it's stupid how it's gone aboutnews.com.au is 90% fakeIts the daily mail of AustraliaI know.

Money is money. Every dollar should be accounted for and saved if possible.And it seems you really don't know how it works
250 million is not enough to patly for anythingAnd it seems you really don't know how it works
250 million is not enough to pay for anythingBecause it was an unnecessary regulationI'm taking issue because you're touting it as "cutting spending"It means very little in the long runIt was a political goal, nothing more..Ever dollar counts. That reasoning right there is why we're 20 trillion in debt.well, looking at portugal or mexico that is not the caseThat's not true at all. Before, it wasn't necessary and it was simply a precaution, but now that companies have thoroughly engrained their businesses through internet services, we absolutely need net neutrality in place so as to guard us from the ensuing fees for being on competitor websites.I don't even know what this innuendo is forNoThe FTC has many provisions against anticompetivie practicesI don't actually know about this. I'm fascinated, do elaborate?The FTC has many provisions against anticompetitive practicesName one.Net Neutrality is not JUST requiring all traffic to be the same. It is the reclassification of every single ISP, no matter how big or small, to Title 2. Title 2 regulates companies (again, no matter how big or small) as if they are monopoly; now, I don't have any specific links saying this, it's a pretty broad topic, but if you really wanna look the full text of Communications Act of 1934 is here(Title 2 starts at page 35): https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf. Essentially, if a Title 2 Common Carrier wants to do anything, they need to first ask the Federal Government.

Bigger points:
- All charges, practices, classifications, and regulations for and in connection with such communication service, shall be just and reasonable, and any such charge, practice, classification, or regulation that is unjust or unreasonable is hereby declared to be unlawful. My problem here is it's on a case-by-case basis. There are no provisions defining what "just and reasonable" means, and it's being decided by agents that, frankly, don't understand the business.

- It shall be unlawful for any common carrier to make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services for or in connection with like communication service, directly or indirectly, by any means or device, or to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, class of persons, or locality, or to subject any particular person, class of persons, or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.  My problem, here, is the same thing. Especially the "locality" part. Meaning, even if you're in a more expensive part of town (more expensive to run lines to) you cost must be charged exactly the same as someone in a more reasonable location. You are paying to support laying lines for people in more rural areas. I live in a "rural area" and understand if my rate is higher, I am okay with it.

- Every common carrier, except connecting carriers, shall, within such reasonable time as the Commission shall designate, file with the Commission and print and keep open for public inspection schedules showing all charges for itself and its connecting carriers for interstate and...between the different points on its own system, and between points on its own system and points on the system of its connecting carriers or points on the system of any other carrier subject to this Act when a through route has been established, whether such charges are joint or separate, and showing the classifications, practices, and regulations affecting such charges. i.e. every ISP needs to release a whole bunch of legal jargon and price sheets for literally everything they do, every price change they make, every expansion they want to do, and the FCC can, at any time, and are required to, inspect them often to make sure they're not doing anything fucky and essentially stop any project they want to do. (that is covered in the following lines, I don't want to flood.) Also, once a price change or expansion is accepted by the FCC, they must wait 120 additonal days. For reasons.- The Commission may, in its discretion and for good cause shown, modify any requirement made by or under the authority of this section either in particular instances or by general order applicable to special circumstances or conditions except that the Commission may not require the notice period specified in paragraph (1) to be more than one hundred and twenty days The FCC is not required to follow the 120 days rule to policy changes.

- The following few pages tell about damages and payment for them. Both of which are determined by the FCC, and not the parties damaged.

- No carrier shall undertake the construction of a new line or of an extension of any line, or shall acquire or operate any line, or extension thereof, or shall engage in transmission over or by means of such additional or extended line, unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the Commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require the construction, or operation, or construction and operation, of such additional or extended line. i.e. ask Daddy Sam if you want to expand.

There are a lot more pages of Title 2. If you want to continue reading, I've only covered to ~page 46.In 2014, Verizon sued the FCC, and won. The Dem's courts ruled that in order for the FCC to continue enforcing Open Internet Regulations(OIR), they MUST make all ISPs Title 2 carriers. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications_Inc._v._FCC_(2014)] It was all they could do at the time, either make them Title 2, or relinquish all Title 2 regulations. In doing so, this also disallowed the FTC from applying their consumer protection regulations against ISPs. The FTC CANNOT regulate Title 2 utilities. They can, however, regulate Title 1.

Now, it is impossible to edit NN, because doing so would affect phone, electricity, cable companies, etc (They are all Title 2 utilities). They're repealing NN(Title 2 reclassification), in doing so they relinquish their ability to enforce OIR (because of Verizon vs FCC) and make ISPs Title 1. So, now that they're Title 1, the FTC can enforce OIR without them being common carriers. It's not an exact replica of the original OIR regulation, mind you, but many of the current regulations the FTC has protects consumers from much of the same things as OIR.

To assuage some of your concerns, from the FCC's release a few weeks ago:
- If an ISP that also sells video services degrades the speed or quality of competing Over the Top video services (such as Netflix),526 that conduct could be challenged as anticompetitive foreclosure. i.e. Verizon cannot promote their services or apps by throttling the cometition.

- 176.We also reject AT&Ts assertion that the Commission should conditionally forbear from all Title II regulations as a preventive measure to address the contingency that a future Commission might seek to reinstate the Title II Order.647 Although AT&T explains that conditional forbearance would provide an extra level of insurance against the contingency that a future, politically motivated Commission might try to reinstate a common carrier classification [2015 Net Neutrality Regulations],648 we see no need to address the complicated question of prophylactic forbearance and find such extraordinary measures [are] unnecessary. i.e. The FCC fully recognizes that, if ISPs get upity and try to slide a fat nasty nude into America's DMs, the FCC reserves the right to return to Title 2.

And finally:
- Should the hypothetical harms that proponents of Title II imagine eventually come to pass, application of the antitrust laws would address those harms.

And, because I need to be neutral, a potential loophole:
Many of the largest ISPs have committed to not to block or throttle legal content.507 These commitments can be enforced by the FTC... The COMMITTED and CAN. If the FTC decides not to restrict an ISP for doing something fucky, then there's nothing we can do except get pissy at the ISP, or the FCC reinstates Title 2. (Then again, that's true with all regulations.)


All that's from combing through the original communications act (something like 400 pages) along with the FCC's repeal  (200 pages) and the FTC's regulations.In conclusion: The previous Net Neutrality rules did MUCH MORE than give us net neutrality, many of which were detrimental to business and consumers. If you want a tl;dr here it is.

Open Internet Rules:
    No Blocking
    No Throttling
    No Paid-Prioritization

Replaced with FTC regulations:
    No monopolies. (lookin at you comcast)
    No collusion. (still lookin at you)
    No consumer abuse
    No unfair business practice. (holy fuck comcast)https://www.google.com/amp/amp.nationalreview.com/article/453984/net-neutrality-not-needed-not-fccs-job2 things.
1. I could get behind serious austerity if we really wanted to fix the economy. But that's not what's happening. 
Serious austerity would mean cutting back social security and medicaid as well as military spending. 
2. I will say again. 250 million means nothing to the 13 trillion deficit.You want to cut pensions and medical care? Go for it.
That *will* fix the deficit.But nobody's proposing that.Because they don't give a shit about saving money.+1Pensions would fuck over current workers Opinion of Ronald Reagan

Right now, as a young citizen if the US, I need to know some part of the government truly understands our problems and isn't just willing to listen to big money.Old age benefits are the most expensive part of the budget.Knife = dickSeriously.The repeal of NN is not about big money.;PBullshit.Let's just let our old people dieYou didn't read what I sent obviouslyJesus christIt was a fucking joke.Oh I did, and it didn't mean anythingYou read 4 blocks of messages in thirty seconds?During a serious conversation. Learn some timing for your future conversationd.Ye :3This person is advocating for killing our old people by cutting of their social securityOof.No, I'm not.
I'm saying that's what austerity would be.No? They were just stating a fact.This isn't austerity.//w//They're saying cut spending on pensions.You need to quit calling cutting cheap shit while wanking to the idea of saving money "saving the budget"And for that matter, they didn't even add an opinion to that fact in their post @Stumblinbear .+2+1When the new years ball drops, will all the pee come out?What does this even meanAgain, I'm not advocating that.
It is what actually, meaningfully fixing the budget ala liberatianism would mean.Social security WAS fine. People paid into it their whole lives to live on it.Until the government decided to steal from itMultiple timesIt means that if you're going to cut smaller expenses and ignore the bigger ones, then you aren't really doing anything for the budget and are just greedy.She's saying cutting period is a load.Well, actually the more important part was the fact that fewer young people are being born rnWell, actually the more important part was the fact that fewer people are being born rn"Rn" meaning the last several decadesRapidly aging population, etcSo cutting things that don't work is bad and not cutting things that people paid their whole lives to reap the benefits of is a bad thing?That's cute hahahaWhat's GOOD in your mindRaising taxes so the government can waste more money?What you're describing was the intentions of those programs, not what actually happened.Alright, ignore social security then.
How about medicare?Would you be ok cutting that?Haiii^That isn't how that'd play out if we raise taxes substantially.When the New Years ball drops will 2018s voice drop?I don't have enough knowledge on medicare to carry on an intelligent conversationHAHHAHHAHAHAHAHAYou do know corporations are also inefficent rightNice argument there bud^There is no argument because it's fucking ridiculousN i c e 
A r g u m e n tCorporations that spend more than they make die.You're just saying you don't want to argue ...that means nothing. You're just trying to say that you're tired of debating with people you disagree with. If that's the case I'm fine with that and I won't judge you for it, I just want to hear that.ThisYou literally cannot use "that's not what would happen" because it's NOT POSSIBLE to know.Unless we look at historyWhat a surprise it doesn't happen that wayCuz pee is stored in it?And i'll give you points for not just jumping in and making shit up :P
It is funded largely by a payroll tax and works as a government funded single payer insurance network.
It is the second most expensive part of the budget.I'm very confused what you're now trying to get across @Stumblinbear.

They'll see it as "ok, they got their 250 M, let's move on." We need greater immediate cuts on the military.Look, we must, on the ground of decency, keep social security until the people on it die. Implement a new system, sure, but don't fuck over the people who rely on itAbsolutely.I fully agree with you there.I was just making a point about the budget.But you're a man, doesn't that mean that you cannot be falsely accused of rape?Social security would've been fine though if the government didn't stick their thieving paws into the moneyXdNow.
One of the major issues is the many loopholes and confusions our tax system has, especially relating to corporations.Tax bill closed a lot of those and tried to simplify itOne of the major concerns of the new tax bill was dropping the corporate tax rate.
That meant little to nothing. :/It tried, yeah. 
I don't know how well it did it yet.Too bad the government doesn't like simpleThey like wasting money on complicatedAs it stands, while the offical corp tax rate is 35%, the effective is 12.6%.Which is less than half of the world average.Do you know how many lawyers it takes to reduce it that much?http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/01/news/economy/corporate-tax-rate/index.htmlThat money could be spent in taxesxDThere's actually an excellent article on tax reformhttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/republicans-are-throwing-away-their-shot-at-tax-reform/546317/Screw VAT, just tax me once pleaseTake 40% for all I careYou get it anywaysAlso, are anyone else's pets being freaked out by the fireworks right now?My dog just sleepsMy cat is seeking shelter under the bedMans not hot 

The guy is not hot (fire album)

The human male is not at a temperature above the norm (combusting music list on a disc)

The homo sapien before us, of which has the XY chromosome, lacks the temperature needed to be considered higher than what would be regarded as a normal temperature. (A combustion reaction occurring on a disc with data that can be played as music)

Hello, ive come to inform you that the sentient being that inhabits the planet earth, who by the way is considered an adult and carries the XY chromosomes and therefore the male reproductive organ, has molecules which vibrate less than normal which disqualify him from acquiring the label of "hot" that is owed to those whos molecules vibrate a lot more (a high temperature oxidation reduction reaction in which combustion of a particular data storage disc is taking place, that disc has data encoded in such a way that certain devices can play music from it)You would think"The paradox of high rates and low yields is explained by the rational lobbying strategy of corporate firms. Business in general would benefit from lower rates. But from the perspective of any individual firm, the highest return on lobbying investment is earned by seeking special favors of value to that particular company or industry. A decade-long effort to reform corporate taxation might reduce the nominal rate to 25 percent. A shrewdly negotiated special favor can cut a companys tax obligation to zero overnight."Are you gayfile.sticker=CAADAQAD7gAD303mBlh51W4vLLnHAgJAJAJAThis is part of why, in the near future, we're fucked as a country.:pAre you gay33.3333 repeating percent gayAww man that number needs to be higherThis was before the reconciled bill was brought forward.

the point of the repeal is to provide larger profit marginsHaha yesNoEVERY. SINGLE. ISP. No matter how big or small is treated like a monopoly.It's a big fucking problem^ basically: America's import laws suck assSo all Japanese 90's American Market cars were slow as fuck"Stiff resistance"Your only argument is "it helps the rich" and that's just regurgitated nonsenseSo 156hp in a Jap car in the late 80's and 90's was A LOT to AmericaKnow what? Sometimes helping the rich is for the benefit of everyone.You mean to tell me that V6 could've actually been powerful?Especially when what you're fixing helps more than the richI mean, look at the Honda Accord Euro-RThats a V6.Especially when what you're fixing hurts more than the richToyota's Camry V6 was also in the Lotus Elise..soooregulations don't hurt small businesses any more than large ones I mean the Elise makes barely 200hp on the high end but still.But the large ones have the money to pay for regulations.especially the ones outlinedReeeaaallySorry, the EARLY Elise makes barely that hpEspecially frivilous onesI knew about the 2ZZ in the Exige, but I didn't know the Elise also had a Toyota engineYeah all Lotus's have Toyota engines more or lessI will concede there. 
But again.
I don't really see how repealing this will help small companies more than pursuing better anti-monopoly legislation.And im sorry i misspokeThr 4cyl that was in the Camry was in the Elise. Not the 6cylThe Elise isnt a 6cyl xD"I'm a small ISP. I'm losing money, and need to raise prices."
FCC: Okay give me your quarterly report, the cost of every single connection to the internet, the cost of all your labor, the cost of hardware, the cost of breathing, and the cost of every single interaction you have with all your customers and other ISPs."
ISP: Uh... Okay, here
*Six months pass*
FCC: Okay you're good to raise prices
ISP: *in debt and bankrupt*The 4cyl that was in the Camry was in the Elise. Not the 6cylhey guyscompanies don't go bankrupt over six monthsBut they lose a lot of fucking money paying for lawyers and accountants to deal with the FCCWhich raises pricesAside from the earliest model of Elise which had that Rover motor.

I think I see what you mean regarding regulation.
But why, exactly, did this require repealing of all the other regulations in place as well?
re., neutrality of traffic, etci have a challenge for everyone 

post all the bone hurting shit you can findfrankly I really don't value the, at most, fifty cents a year this costs meThe previous administration FORCED. The FCC to make all ISPs title 2 carriers (NN) if they wanted to continue enforcing Open Internet Regulations.WhatMWhat?No Title 2 means they can't enforce the rules. So they did all they could and repealed it, giving the FTC jurisdiction again/r/bonehurtingjuice has some prime examplesfuck.
I hadn't actually read into this.
open internet's been fucked since 2014.are you okHe asked for bone hurting memesThis is frankly really depressing now.oof ow thanksTHANK you.I still think NN should have been kept, though.This is why everyone's against itOpen internet is more valuable than competition.*why a lot of people didn't like ObamaThe FTC doesn't have jurisdiction to create new regards until they have powerThe FTC doesn't have jurisdiction to create new regs until they have powerBecause being against it is WORK.hey guysWe don't vote on laws because the general populous doesn't know the laws. We vote people in who are paid to understand them.I genuinely hope they do do this then.Tis all we have when we cast our votesHopeBelieve me, it was months of me being angry at the FCC before I looked into the lawshttps://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/12/ftc-fcc-outline-agreement-coordinate-online-consumer-protection
https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/12/07/dont_rely_on_us_to_protect_the_open_internet_warns_ftc_commissioner/can't say I'm optimisticyou've successfully convinced me that it's not just the FCC.
it's a far wider issue of corporate lackyism.The fuck happened here?In a real world situation, she notes, it could take years for the FTC to get a court order to stop a company from carrying out harmful conduct  at which point a large and powerful ISP could drive a competitor out of business. "Even if the FTC were ultimately to prevail, we couldnt resurrect the dead rival," she notes.The FTC has a pretty good history of protecting consumersCompanis will do shitty things. Just as people do. A law written doesn't not mean it doesn't happenThe Commissioner herself is saying they aren't going to do much.as in, they *can't* do much.hihttps://qz.com/1144994/the-fcc-plans-to-kill-the-open-internet-dont-count-on-the-ftc-to-save-it/
ignore sensationalist title.If the ISPs take advantage of consumers, the FCC has directly stated they reserve the right to reinstate Title 2.Most ISPs will follow the law, if one doesn't the law will eventually deal with it. The cogs of law can be slow but they do eventually reach a destination.Bone hurtingwe're still gonna get fucked until it does.
it won't be the end of days but I solidly bet internet is about to become a ton more expensive for the next few years at least.Yeah, you did an A+ job sending useless spamAnd you'll get fucked until it's fixed before NN is repealed.won't know until it happens.Something LITERALLY happened earlier this yearFebruary or somethingDevil we know, innit.

Hopefully it gets better soon.The law will be broken, you can't stop it from happeningIf anything I hope this incentivizes towns to create municipal networksWhich would solve everythinghey what's up guysHaha uesHaha yesyes pleaseI read about a town that had one, then sold it to a company because everyone hoped to get richEveryone got a hundred bucks and prices doubledPeople are stupid What are you?

Anyone is free to do what they like.
It's all cool.The point is, children need both the mother and the father in the house, not the father in prison like so often happens in the inner-city or the father separatedThe lack of a strong male role model affects the development of male children especiallyWhat2018 is very niceXDThat escalated quicklyfile.sticker=CAADAwADmwADwHE5B8ZNLVt9jKgOAgShould I grab my micWell, you get similar results from families with only a father soooooLmaoJust hop in discord, i got sean in hereShouldI grab my micSurehECKIt's, from what I remember, more due to the lack of a parent able to raise the child, work/finance etcDiscord link?A lesbian couple is perfectly able to raise a childSame with a gay couplehttps://discord.gg/hdKpbhI just used the father missing as the example because it's what happens in the overwhelming majority of casesI don't like the idea of a polyamorous relationship, it would feel weird for meAnd that's fine!

Thanks.I dunno, maybe I'm just an insensitive butthole uwuThoughts and prayers because we definitely didn't allow this to happen by being SJW's and burying away the rampant homophobia and sexism for politic purposesOh so saying for me to shut up with cuss words is making it more matureOh okVS thoughts and prayers for somebody who just died for absolutely no reasoncompletely different thing..^^^^^AAAABlinding!!Damn so many white peopleI know.

Every day.3 days.Fuck right off with thatAnywayWhy the fuck did you goThe last service always lasted until like 12:00I was forced, mostly.As someone who was verbally abused as a child in the name of Christianity, I have an inherent hatred of religionAhit's a surreal feeling tho
The last day, they decide to bring up the topic of gay marriage, and they say something like "This is why the world is going bad, is because people think they can do whatever they want, they think they can marry whoever, they want, they think they can choose their gender, well, you can't choose."The whole arena cheersYes, we can marry whoever we wantlegally, but you'll go to hellI agree that gender is static, and not something that you should be changingLmaoo that would suckI couldn't give 2 shits about heaven or hell, those are religious constructsUghhhOh god theres the two reasons Im going to helland that stuff still scares meUghhhhhhhhReligion pisses me offChristianity is basically a cult these daysMost Christians are moderatesJust like all group they have their extremesstill tho, not liking gays is like, one of their core beliefsCult is just a name people of a larger religion give to a smaller oneBeing gay at a Catholic middle and high school really trains you to hate themYeah trueMost kids raised in extreme catholic households eventually lose their beliefsAnd moderates aren't greatNot really,it was just one guy, and we all know how easy it would be to be like "uh-de-b-GOD SAYS NOT TO DO THATT"Every moderate makes the crazies seem a bit less out of the ordinaryThe highlight of that trip is that there was this really really hot chaperone therelike, he was a 10Like, if one more old fucker comes up to me saying I can't go around liking guys because I'll go to hell I'm literally going to punch him and walk away. I'm beyond fed up with it. I couldn't care less about your hypothetical hell.Hell yeahbut he was just as much of a Jesus freak as the restDon't do thatDont punch an old person pleaseand straightBut do ask if he's wearing mixed fabrics What are you?

It's a small thing, really.Do you mean stolenno stop ok plzezEgoism as a philosophy is not a love of self. It's a basis for what is moral that lies primarily on the idea of what enables individuals to do what they like- a concept of freedom from outside influences to pursue happiness. Laws are of course one of these influences, so egoism necessitates anarchism. Capitalism by nature exploits people- the people who own things that generate money will always use these things to extract wealth from those who do not have it. This is a hierarchy which must be enforced violently (Revolution of workers to collective ownership would be inevitable if not for laws preventing it, laws can only be enforced through a threat of police violence) (against principle of anarchism) and limit a majority of people (those without property which can be used to accumulate wealth must allow wealth to be extracted from them or else starve) (against principle of egoism)...DropIs deliciousIt's the Dutch word for liquoriceNow, I haven't really read much about egoism, but to my understanding, an egoist would support this on the grounds that they find personal fulfillment by helping others, and that aiding in the protection of others also helps to ensure their own protection. An egoist, even after hypothetically ridding themselves of societal standards and ethics (i.e. certain "spooks"), could still find fulfillment in helping others because our species has evolved to be a social one, wherein members of a community have a tendency to help one another for the betterment of all. This results in an instinct to aid others and not act purely selfishly, but the logic also makes sense on a conscious level, so an egoist could and likely would also justify such actions on this basis. In other words, if they help their community, their community is more likely to help them in return.If someone can't accept the fact that you are homosexual then they're a close minded judgemental ass hole who should in fact, go to hell instead.

Thus, if you want to avoid these sorts of power differences, then you would also want to avoid the accumulation of wealth.

Capitalism is a system where individuals own the means of production, rather than the workers who use them. This has nothing to do with free trade and if anything is harmful to it. It allows for mass accumulation of wealth which can be used to bar others from it- in fact, in a profit centric system, the rich will do everything in their power to hold onto their wealth and prevent competition from rising. This means that in effect free trade in a capitalist profit based system destroys itself by creating its own rulers and restricters.file.sticker=CAADAQADPAADwbN3DnSScWzOFiKNAgThis, and in doing so the "free market" isn't so fereeThis, and in doing so the "free market" isn't so freehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KvPsANmBakThis fox is so cutefile.sticker=CAADAQADbAgAAoFuVwUMuSeOQnJZmgIBut mine is cuterfile.sticker=CAADAQADowcAAoluywoYd1hdX12aKQIThe people at the top want more money, so they pay their workers less.

The government literally controls the foodThis still implies a currency-centric mindset. IN the proposed system there is no such thing as "funding" apart from what would essentially amount to pooling resources. The only use for labor vouchers would be to incentivize those who can work to work. BUt if you cannot work, there is no reason that you could not simply be given the food and other products that others produce.i hate thisJust put some food aside jesusIE social security, welfare, a minimum wage, etcbtw my stance on taxation is that it is 100% theft by definition but its still moral because its for the greater goodAll funded off excess capitalHow would a country keep itself afloat with other countries when there is no common currencyTbh thisone way is to convert the vouchers into a currency when trading with other countriesMy stance is that it is immoral theft when applied to the poor, but partial justice when applied to the rich.But then wouldn't that not work because anyone could just put whatever they want as a price for the vouchers since it is not monetary Which time zone are you in?

a product = how long on average it takes to makeLolI tried to mod a holy trainer to fit on me and when I moved out for college my parents found itoofim so sorryThey treated it the exact same way they did when they found my med. Fenrir:They threw it out and didn't say a wordBut wouldn't that hour of work not be monetary to the amount of work done because in a factory it is hard to track who made exactly what.wowI see no need for that. All that you would need to do is what is normally done in international trade and perform a two-part trade: first trade the resources you produce for the common currency, then trade the currency you acquired for more resources. The only stipulation would be that when you acquire the currency, it has to be put into a pool that is accountable to all citizens, so that no one can steal any and use it for their own purposes. Now, this isn't optimal because you'd still be supporting outside countries which have capitalist economies. Even if trade is necessary to some degree though, it can be off-set by encouraging a reduction in unnecessary consumption, promoting economic self-reliance within the country's borders, and accepting donations from foreign sympathizerrs.I'd be so pissed about my parents throwing away my dildoThat shits expensiveon an unrelated note, to claim everything as part of you is selfishI fuckin was dudeThat was before they cut prices on those things so I paid like $130I think identity is as much a societal discourse as it is a personal thingThat was like half of my first paycheckRippAlso there still hasn't been a solution to how elderly retirement would workMy dildos are still safeMine are too nowI brought em with me so the bathroom now has a med roland in the drawer and my family is none the wiserHow have they not found it?make programs, do the equivalent of taxes with voucher or directly with resources, how is that an issue?make programs, do the equivalent of taxes with vouchers or directly with resources, how is that an issue?Would you just kill them if they became uselessNo one uses the drawers in the bathroom.RiskyBut then that would eat into what the hard workers deservenothing ever happens until it does manAt least, the ones I use.

(They work similar to the banks) their are rules against them using any of said money though.Oh noSorryJust a few things I'd like to say in terms of the long gone argument of taxes. 
I believe in generosity. But more importantly I believe in freedom. Taxes and government must be upheld with force- we all know this- and I don't believe the consent of the governed can ever truly exist. Being born is not a signature on a contract agreeing to being forced to do things. Lucy's and Aiden's arguments in favor of a system with high taxes for redistribution are alarmingly authoritarian in my eyes and I'm sure many people here are influenced by libertarian (anti-authoritarian, not necessarily capitalist) thought and any arguments for taxes won't sway anyone here. I'd like to point out that left wing systems do not need taxes or any government, and the ideal in anarchist circles is to base questions of retirement funds and those unable to work on what society can provide. If you were to go on the street, stand on a soapbox and cry for gloves to be given to the warm and those with gloves, nobody would agree with you; on the other hand, if you advocated giving them first to the cold and gloveless, nearly everyone would agree with you wholeheartedly and praise you for your common sense. Why should this be any different for food, or housing, or any of society's benefits? This redistribution of goods does not need any form of government. It does not need any force. It's common sense of common people, and the only thing standing in the way of distribution on such principles is the greed promoted by capitalism.So hows everyones night/afternoon/morningI would like to post the old mother of God meme, but I'm too lazy to Google itI crave deafSorry I cant hear you2018 we bring back rage comics, like we tried in 2017 or 2016*blows out your eardrums*I read vibratorThere's a cicada just outside my front doorhttps://money.howstuffworks.com/personal-finance/banking/credit-union.htmthat's what a loan isWhich kindThankCicadas suckcredit unions can give out loansIs it the fast chirping kind or the slow chirpingThe..

by that logic money is worthless in capitalism because welfare exists

even though there are programs to get things without spending doesnt mean money isnt needed to assign price and run the whole economyNew Zealanders build island in bid to avoid alcohol ban

the only way to get money in capitalism is by working, being given it, or accumulating it by already having moneyIm moving to New ZealandI wanna pet a kiwiRight. So we leverage (but don't rely on) government action to lift capitalism from society. We have to primarily organize horizontally through current society until something can trigger a mass rebellion.

Improve your odds by using binaryNo waitBase pi10I like binaryBase piwhat? Pi doesn't have a last digit, it is proven.10 = My favourite is Cherry PiI know number bases but why use a non-integer baseSo you can do this^What i said was unproveable was what the number of the last digit isAightIt's unprovable what bd is in my assWell at least i know the last digit is zero in that base thenBecause there isn't onewell it doesn't really make sense eitherThat doesn't make senseSo this doesn'tI've got a really dumb ideaPi contains every finite series of digits, right?Rightit's not proven.Ok well theoretically pi doesNot factuallyCuz i know there are irrational numbers that dont have every set of digits like 0.101001000100001000001...I was unaware an irrational number could contain not all finite series. Can you explain how?Ah I seeSo after a finite number of digits, it could forever collapse into only 9 or less digitsI don't like thatPossiblyBut honestly the likely hood of pi collapsing into 9 digits infinitely is basically zeroBut honestly the likelihood of pi collapsing into 9 digits infinitely is basically zeroSo after a finite number of digits, it could forever collapse into only 9 or less possibilities for each digitWell actually it IS zeroChanged the wording because it was wrongI get what you meanno, because it's not known if pi's digits are random in nature.Like you mean at a certain point after a certain number of digits you never see a 1 again in piAnd even then they could still be random but have no 8s after a certain pointThey seem to befile.sticker=CAADAQADOwEAAjk0rg-vBTi9SgFZrwIShare your ballsnoOkayBut again you got an infinite number of digitsyou can't make meif it is random, it has infinite 8s, infinite 9s etcI dont think a certain number would terminateBut then you don't have all possible series of digitsThere would sure be cosmic pauses but not a permanent endyeah, but nobody has proven that it is randomfile.sticker=CAADAQADuQADl7EZDnHpT-YzCZE8AgWell you cant disprove they're random. Idk how one would do a proof of an infinite irrational numberIt's proven to be irrational so guessing digit n+1 after knowing all digits up to n is a fair guessIf it wasn't infinite, you could write it down without the decimal point and divine by 100[basically a fuckton of zeroes]000. Making it rational.If it wasn't infinite, you could write it down without the decimal point and divide by 100[basically a fuckton of zeroes]000. Making it rational.If it was finite then it would be rationalMultiplying by the fuckton of zeroes would make it an integerYe that's my pointWait I misread this and that's why I bothered proving thatI really don't like that I don't know proof for or against this ever happeningNo, fuck you!file.sticker=CAADAQADIQADgNtGDDGBgdvoRXHvAgPlsGet your arse over here then.file.sticker=CAADAQADVwAD7oy0D3BM78Eb1nfJAgBrb buying plane ticketsfile.sticker=CAADAQADUgAD7oy0D5exmMDkLm2LAgTurns out you can prove that you can't prove this one way or the otherNow I really don't know how to feel about thatMy ten digit mobile number occurs in piEvery number ever relevant to your existance occurs in piYou can only prove this via finding it directlyNot necessarilyhttps://github.com/philipl/pifsI can prove to you that you cannot prove thatHave done so.

They are also handed out sequentiallyAnd the ten digits includes that "area code" as the first two digitsOkay. What carrier are you with?that's still 1000 numbers you gotta call> handed out sequentially

https://youtu.be/mkKVixISUgIDanger dobermen. The meltdown was amazingDoesn't sound like the best idea, asking the masses about what should the resources of labor be focused on directly doesn't sound like a great idea, people are usually shortsighted and unable to think on the long run, and also usually lack the complex understanding of social interplay and interact between different fields of investment, stuff like basic scientific research, space research and a lot other things might get overlooked

For example, say that a certain town realises that they need more concrete to construct houses. All they have to do is send in an order to a nearby concrete "factory" (not sure if that's quite the right term here, but it'll do) saying "hey, we need x amount of concrete for constructing houses, but it's not desparately needed." With the amount of product needed and the level of urgency established, the concrete factory can then get to work producing the concrete mix and sending it out to the various towns that sent orders for it, giving it to the towns that needed it most urgently first. This same process could likely be applied to almost all resources and products, so it would be an efficient way of managing a gift economy without needing large-scale collective decision -making at given intervals of time.Thats sarcasmBut let me tell yaLovely weatherA balmy fuckin 3 degrees fahrenheitNah it's notI'd love that coleI'd love that coldwanna pmVs fucking 54 in January54Wanna rpgThat is too hot for januaryWanna pms54 sounds comfortablepm meI wanna live in northern california cuz they have moderate year round tempsyeah, i forgot about this solution for the problem of estimating the cost of future investmentssliding into dms likefile.sticker=CAADBAADXQADKnrCEkJ3EpiCkWAHAgI wanna live in a dumpster, that way I can be the trash I amfile.sticker=CAADAQADFQAD4VMOF6paTJ2YfQbiAgdont have such a low sense of self worthMy favorite thing about the thought process of a gift economy is that it's only gotten more plausible and practical over time due to technological developmentsToo hot for janMemesI want like -10coh okHow do you know that you like it that cold?Eh well i don't know precisely but I really enjoyed the weather last year when it was a weekend of -7 feels like -10 in the early morningit will be practical when we reach post scarcityLike I was getting up and going for 7am swims for an excuse for a 6am walkHave we not achieved that already?Now that is a spicy debatethen from each according to his ability, to each according to his need will truly come into practice, anyone can take anything they need out of society and contribute what they canthere is still scarcity, real scarcity not just artificialFor which resources?im not sure what you mean by thisname something that costs money to make

I mean, as far as I can tell, all that labor vouchers would tell us is how much labor went ito making a certain product. But that seems like a pretty irrelevant fact to know.So why eat it last, you're just clearing away the delicious pizza flavorCuz I need to hold itITS NOT THE SAMETwo handsIt's the exact sameThats what the next slice is forSorry I was talking to myselfWHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU RUN OUTThen you buy morefile.document=CgADBAADxZ8AAg4ZZAeaxiV35KobOgIAnd you never stop eating itTHATS WHY IM FAT OKWhy would we need to know that?

No matter how much it costs to make a house, a concrete factory is going to produce the same amount of concrete no matter what. And as long as that concrete is distributed according to the communities that need it the most, then there should be no problem that wouldn't arise under any other system (i.e. a problem that occurs simply due to the concrete factory's lack of sufficient productive capabilities). Plus, even if some misdistribution did occur and a town that didn't need concrete that much got more concrete than they needed, then backfeeding would allow them to simply donate their excess concrete mix to other towns that needed it more.Why does this have to happenfile.document=CgADAQADDwADq-GhR6IpezOj1TQ0Agwhy would the concrete factory not change its production based on needs at that time, producing the same amount no matter what would be very wastefulfile.sticker=CAADAQADGAEAAg8jgw4AAbN2oipBRkoCAww it's angereryTrue. I should've clarified myself by saying "maximum productive capabilities." They would make the concrete based on the amount of conrete that is ordered on any given day. But if they receive orders for too much concrete, then no matter what, regardless of how much it "costs" to produce a house or other resource, they won't be able to fill all of the orders, and they'll simply have to go by the communities that need the concrete the most, and hope that the other communities can get by on backfeeding.a house doesnt just take concrete, it also takes labor which would be taken away from other thingsDid you use your escort money for thisAngereryMhmfor that reason both the amount of concrete and of labor time would need to be knownMadi are you angererysomeone still needs vouchers for building the houseNofile.document=CgADAQADDwADq-GhR6IpezOj1TQ0AgWELL I AMO fukfile.sticker=CAADAQADXQADquOkEiOjmStt_k9JAgThis is something my friend got for me

But I believe that that sort of consideration can be handled on a communal level the vast majority of the time, and would not require the need for any form of voucher. Communities would be able to decide for themselves what resources they need to invest labor in the most. This could even arise naturally for the most part by people simply volunteering to work on things as jobs come up. And if more people decide to work on a certain job than is needed, then those already working the job would likely be able to recognize this and could disallow more volunteers from arriving.Plus, you have to consider the fact that in a communist society, there would be far more labor to go around than there is today, given increased automation, and the dissolving of jobs purely for capitalist or state institutions, which currently employ tens of millions of adults in the US alone. Jobs such as accountants, bank tellers, government employees (not including teachers), people working for "leisure businesses" such as hotels, resorts, cruises, etc., and many others.With these sorts of jobs gotten rid of, there would be much more labor to go around in order to invest in more important things such as house construction, food production, cleaning, etc.bootifulGood luck with your transition whenever you go ahead with it tho bud Is it one of those guys that go >\\\\\\\<Me irlThanksp much

This is Clay Redmon, the owner of the telephone number this account is tied to. I got a call earlier at work from a friend that was a bit shocking involving this application. I downloaded it and I've taken a look at different histories of messages and tried to figure out what all is going on. From what I can tell, my friend's likeness as well as my own are both being used without our knowledge or understanding why, including making multiple relationships, scams of money out of people, and generally disgusting/improper behavior. I have no idea at all how my number was spoofed or faked or whatever, but this account will be deleted. If possible, I would like it if it could be banned in any chat groups I'm in or blocked or whatever its called on this app. On my behalf, I apologize for anything that has been said or done on this account. Please delete any pictures that have been sent of me or my friend if possible.

For further information: All sonas used on the account actually belong to me and my girlfriend Emily. They have been stolen and used, and even art has been purchased of them with their likeness being used without my consent. If you are currently working on something for this person, please stop. It appears as if they even went as far as figuring out my occupation, school, online name, Discord, etc through my Facebook account. The passwords for my Facebook, Discord, Twitter, PayPal, and other subsequent accounts have been changed with 2FA turned on for each that I can, and I will not allow this to happen again. I'm thoroughly confused and will keep alert of any more suspicious activity, but if anyone would like to get to know me or ask me any questions about anything, my twitter account is actually ZamRL and my email for contact is askzamrl@gmail.com. I will not respond to any further messages here.

Again, sorry for whatever nonsense this has caused. This account will be deleted shortly. If you find any of this unclear, please contact me and I will try to tell as much as I was able to figure out.Holy shit, that is crazyWtfIt was the so called "Amber"Whos amberA, I guess former, user hereIt's too late now, the account was already deletedOh fuckWhat the fuckBiggest suprise drama I have seen in foreverBiggest surprise drama I have seen in foreverfile.sticker=CAADAQADjAADpKEpBGK8uVGQq9x1AgLmao what the fuckThat's kinda fucked thoughLook at this photographfile.sticker=CAADAQADmAADpKEpBFOSHo5nE9w_Agfile.sticker=CAADAQADnAADpKEpBLezUgsxcrTEAgfile.sticker=CAADBAADIgEAAip6whIrZasYKXakvQIwanna pmanthraxfile.sticker=CAADBAADsQEAAip6whI8BsoltVD6cwIHow you retrowave your sona like thatLol weirdwhich partAll.

More like shitty -3- *mic drop*Labor vouchers are practically currency that has no trade value or any of the good parts of real currenciesAny form of currency or labor voucher still has inherent within it the coersion of people to extract labor. Many leftists denounce capitalism partially for the reason that it forces people to work for capitalism so that they can have access to necessities such as food, energy, housing, healthcare, etc. But this still holds true under a labor voucher system, just with the change that the exploitation is committed by the community rather than the capitalist. WOrk is still coerced from you so that you can buy various necessities with labor vouchers. Perhaps if labor vouchers were only used to afford luxuries, then it may be more justifiable in this sense. But even then, I believe that it represents an unnecessary complication to the economy.XD dude I was joking tooApple is an infinitely better nameI found tide pod eroticaThink I haven't that one before?help meDamnI knew you were joking, but I just wanted you to know that Kiren is a cute name.this is the fucking worstHow?

cuz bees don't cawe what humans fink ish impossibwe. owo;wait who's side are you onWell, I would need clarification on what you mean exactly by "efficient," but other than that I'll do my best to give a rough overview of anarchist organization. As a synthesist anarchist, I envision there being a wide variety of regions in the world with differing social organizations, much like there are today between different countries, but all geared towards anarchism. Different regions might have market (but hopefully not capitalist) economies, or mutualist economies, or collectivist economies, or communist economies, etc. I'm only an ancom in the sense that my personal preference would be to live in a communist economy. Now, trade would be a small issue between these regions due to differing beliefs about currencies, with some regions having normal money, others having labor vouchers, and many likely having no money at all. But I've outlined before how this problem could be worked around, and I can just forward that message if need be. Now, having differing regions without governments to control weapons seems like a recipe for large outbreaks of war. However, I don't believe this would be the case. Partially for the reason that anarchism does away with national and ideological identities which are pushed on people from a young age by their governments and which represent a major cause of war between nations. And also partially for the reason that growing up in non-authoritarian environments has a tendency to make people far less violent, as has been observed in many hunter-gatherer societies. Now, that's where I'll leave the large-scale consideration of organization between regions. Since I've mostly just studied anarcho-communist beliefs, I'll only be talking about that form of organization from here on. I'm sure you can ask other people about how different anarchist regions might be alternatively organized. 

So, in an ancom society, and any society really, the two most important considerations to be made are how resources are to be distributed and how policy decisions should be made. As for the first question, I've explained before how I believe anarchist communes should go about distributing resources; i.e. via a large-scale computer network that transmits and catalogues orders for resources. The software for this computer system would, of course, all be open-source and open to public scrutiny and suggestions so as to prevent corruption by individuals and to allow for its constant improvement. Now, if a town needed some amount of resource x, then they would simply send a message out to x factories, and also to other communities, saying how much they need and with what urgency. They would then be delivered a shipment of resource x from either the factory or other towns that have an excess of x. This way, waste of resources is prevented and needs are fulfilled as they arise. Beyond this, resource distribution within communities would function on a more explicitly gift-based economy, wherein all resources are free to take, and members of the community are expected to take only what they need and to help in producing resources themselves if they are physically or mentally capable of it. Some might identify a potential for abuse in this system, where some people might not participate well and take more than they need, or not help in adding to the pool of resources. However, if people are brought up in a society that encourages communal participation and denounces over-consumption, then these cases are likely to be relatively rare. And they do occur, they almost certainly will not be catastrophic and could be identified and dealt with appropriately. FInally, there is the consideration of policy decision-making.  For this, I would envision that people would organize a tiered system of representation and deliberation. By this I mean that at the bottom you have affinity groups, groups of people consisting of anywhere from 15 to 150 people that are close to one another and who will come to a decision on their own.These people (if the decision in question affects more than just them), will then elect a representative among them to present their opinion and reasoning to the representatives of other affinity groups, who will ultimately come to a decision of their own which everyone can agree on. This concensus-building and representative process continues up more and more tiers until all parties affected are satisfied. This sort of system is often used among certain protestors to organize demonstrations. Most decisions are made by individual affinity groups, but when a decision is made on a wider scale, this tiered representation tactic is often employed.Yours, stinkyboyefile.sticker=CAADAQADtAkAAq8ZYgdb6HKKyFUOjgIHey, wait!I'm not a stinkyboy!YupYou're a stinkyboyeDifferentAlso,

We were discussing left wing chat rooms earlier. I think the best one for serious discussion which is inclusive of non-lefties is @unitedleft. It's mine so I'm biased, but prot tends toward banning people they disagree with, and leftism tends towards memes. UL has very few memes and quite a few right of center people@rwarPaws 

If I asked what you want in the end, you'd tell me you would want anarchy via communism, which would make you a Marxist Anarchist in the context of the question.

If I asked what you want to do to reach your goals for society, you'd tell me you would want anarchy via communism, which would make you a Anarchist Marxist in the context of the question.Is this for me or @holmesincFor everyone who was discussing various leftist groups a bit ago@DJM011602Ah.jpegWill joinI love lick paws :3cOh wow group butler refers to me as supreme leader.

"Idk what to think about it. I dont think Logan knows what its like to be depressed to the point of suicide. Him and Jake seem to be spoiled. I think he was just trying to get rid of the uncomfortableness of the situation by laughing because he really doesnt know better. I think hes too blind to suffering because of how he might have been raised so he doesnt know how to react in the moment. Its perspectives from two different worlds. Idk I just think its annoying how everyones screaming bloody murder at him and writing their news articles when they should know this is just how Logan is. Its fucked but its no surprise"

Me:
"I agree that Logan has reasons for his faulty response, yet I believe the ones who truly don't are the Logang atm. When they don't know the camera is on them, they're chuckling, and some even laugh out loud once the camera is on them." What are you?

XDThe police is basically a military thololNot really, do you see them driving down the street in a m1 AbramsThey both use force or at least the threat of force to enforce the will of the governmentPretty sure that's a thing in some placesWell my ass hole could say I used to adventure on that sideYo I finally got nitwExplore everythingNo, the most they will use is bulletproof vests ar15s and armored cars.It's one of those games that reward you for taking your timehttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/08/27/trump-expected-lift-ban-military-gear-local-police-forces/606065001/That's not quite right, given the definition of marshal law as rule under the military. Even if you count the police as being essentially equivalent to a form of military, there is still a qualitative difference in that most governments are run completely differently than the military. One runs on the deliberation of elected representatives, the other is governed by the orders of unelected military officials on their individual whims. Though, both are similar in that they exclude the populous from participation in decision-making.Also gregg rulez okAnd thats in maximum security threat situationsive played a bit of thati should really finish it sometimeHell yeahGregg best waifuAh yes a good counterargument.

And it's obvious there's always gonna be someone with more moneywell that way of pricing really adjusts itself with demandIf you auction one slot. Even 2 people can bid this highfair fair, but the people with the most money are gonna be the ones paying that moneyTo be fair it's a great way to distribute the potential for a slotfind a cheaper fursuit makerYeah but that raises the bar for everyone.

You believe in stories written a thousand years ago as if they're fact. I have yet to see any proof that it actually happened. Religion is a way to remain blissfully ignorant, for you know how the universe works(or believe that it cannot or should not be known), thus standing in the way of forward progress. Religion allows you to not be accountable for your actions because the lORD ALMIGHTEH told you to, therefore it is not your fault.

I do not believe in religion. They are stories meant to control a defunct, uneducated population.You could be speaking gaelige rn if you wanted to but ya didn't pay attention in school did yaI can speak itYou speak gaylyThat is how children are controlled. Scare them into compliance.T ocras ormThe difference is my boss is alive and actually has control over my life.

I'll believe it when it's proven.Heh. Im saying you could have had the most abusive parents and it wouldn't disprove anything.Those theories are falsifiableIt's the reason I don't beliveYou also cant prove he does, so I believe he doesnt. Thats just how Ive chosen to live.SameYeah it's the same for meThey weren't until quantum mechanics were noted.Yes they wereBut they weren't until quantum mechanics were noted.._.K thenThere is no logic here, only optionFalsifiable means that it CAN be proven to be false or wrong, not that it IS+1Please dont spamLogical? What's logical about blindly believing in a story written a thousand years agoBut nobody could prove it was false until they had an alternative, that's how alternatives work lolIt cannot be proven. In your own words. Therefore blindly.Being blind implies you do it just because it tells you to. You can believe in something because you perceive it's impacts, and the realness of those impacts becomes moot.Being blind implies you do it just because it tells you to. You can believe in something because you perceive its impacts, and the realness of those impacts becomes moot.Not on science, it is falsifiable if there is a logical structure that can prove it to be wrong
Like, "graviti works this way" can be proven to be false if you find an experiment in which gravity does NOT work the way you hypothesised, the same is not possible for things like God, there is no logical way to disprove the existance of GodAll of that is trueMy umbreon hoodie is like goddamn good and insulatedI'm shockedTho when I sit I usually sit on my tailPersonally, if you can't percieve something in one mindset, you must utilize another or you destroy your ability to percieve reality.We see this discussed by both Nietzsche and KierkegaardHaI sincerely don't understand what you meanTails are evil sometimes.Personally, I believe that if you can't percieve something in one mindset, you must utilize another or you destroy your ability to percieve reality.It's unfalsifiableObviously you can't prove it falseWell if people say they percieve their world outside of a scientific/logical mindset, then you might have to consider a romantic, religious, or something else mindset.Oh yeah now I get itWhich?Yeah if you want to understand their mindset and behavior you surely should do thatTry to prove me wrong when I say god doesnt exist. With solid evidence.I'm not followingYay I've reached a world mindset compromise with @udinanon I feel happyAs an evangelical I believe that if our church has any chance of reaching more people, our church needs a guide for both the religious and scientific worlds, where they can communicate with both "languages."MgmMhm1. Water has to be drank every day. If you're stabbed you bleed liquid and water. It is safe to assume the first prediction wasn't impossible.

2. Iron didn't fall from the sky. It exists all through the Earth's many layers. Not a good example.

3. Protective atmosphere is not godly. It exists on pretty much every planet ever.

4. I fail to see how this one is relevant. They aren't even related 

5. I disagree that the literal expansion is what they were referencing when it was written. But it's questionable.

6. Haha yes because being wrong and contradicting the science at the time was something they did best. Regardless of any jabs, the kind of thinking of orbiting the sun wasn't common, but it certainly wasn't non-existent at the time.

7. I fail to see how that's proof of anything. If you think about it for half a second underwater movements are an easy explanation for waves.

8. I disagree that it was premonition because "back of the head" would've been really weird to say. When you talk to someone you see their face, and they knew where the brain was, so I can see he logic in saying "forehead"

9. I'd imagine people back when this was written had lost feeling in their hands or skin due to fire, before. I fail to see how this is proof.

 5 people have voted so farA joke is a form of folklore where a regular construction is used to provide humor. If it has no regular structure, it is a different form of folklore entirely :VWhy does it have to be folkloreYes, but it needs to install critical thinking into its students so that what would otherwise be mandatory knowledge would be easily learnable without trying to drive individual bits of knowledge into their minds.I think the basic concept of common core- that is, a universal standard of education that every high school has to follow- is a good one. Colleges and places of employment need to know that a high school degree from one school means the same thing as another, or at least that certain classes teach up to a certain point. Reading "calculus" on one student's transcript and having it be the same as "algebra 2" on another's, as a poor and impractical example.

School districts are essentially the smallest

 6 people have voted so farYeah a fiat currency is far more useful and able to deal with shitty financial decisionsThe power of pc gamingIf we're not going to do anything about the banking industry the next best thing is empowering the fedhaha yes I also like uncontrollable inflation...that's one of the issues with non-fiat currencyLmfla9What do you call finding shit tons of gold in places like Central and South Americas then?But why get rid of a physical object that has use from behind a currency.LmaoBecause it got to the point where it didn't provide as much as a benefit as not having it would have.Simple change in popular tasteNo, because the government didn't have enough money and they wanted to print more.Giving control of our currency to the federal reserve was also a fucking stupid moveBecause when a currency's value can be controlled better when it's not tied to a specific valueSo, it would be better to have a fidget spinner currency if its under popular taste.Why?Sounds godSounds god likeThe federal reserve is a private entity. We pay millions a year in interest of a private fucking company.Only they'd really offer roughly the same amount of benefit, sureOnly if they'd really offer roughly the same amount of benefit, sureThey aren't a private companyThe federal reserve is a private entity. We pay millions a year in interest to a private fucking company.No, they are a privately owned corporation.They're private in that they cannot be influenced arbitrarily by congressBut they don't have shareholders, they don't make profits, etcThey're a branch of the governmentDon't make profits?? Then who the hell are we paying interest to.The government, and therefore the people, own its wealth. Just because parts of the government can't access it, doesn't mean it's privately owned, but it also means that it's not entirely publically owned...what?Whose interest?We pay interest on our 20 trillion.It comes out of the yearly budget.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System

not trying to be condescendingThe debt isn't to the federal reserve...Whatever, same difference.Although an instrument of the U.S. Government, the Federal Reserve System considers itself "an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress, and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms."[22]What I assume you're referring toIt's to corporations who buy government bonds, which is facilitated by the fedOkay I stand corrected on that section. The rest is still ridiculous.Like, as often as I rally against central authority the fed is surprisingly good in concept (when not blatantly ignoring corruption >->).Send dick picsYou know pics of people named dickOh, thanksYour welcomefile.sticker=CAADAQADNgADQWb7DYLgQJrUVg57AgHere hsve some of my memes, some are made by meFeel free to use them so i can feel better about myselfOf course, but the feds should stick to what they exist for and stop butting in to the state's businessI actually fully agree with thatfile.sticker=CAADAQADHgADQWb7Df1EHfv2NpzkAgLike

The articles of confederation were better than this pseudo-authoritarian mess.
Common laws of open borders and trade similar to the E.U. would be far more suitable.Hell, even some *states* are too big.City-states heyoKHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANThe biggest issues would be places like mississippi or louisiana that would entirely implode if federal funding was cut offTangent: the Texas state constitution has an article which would allow it to instantaneously split into 5 states without consulting congress or the federal governmentAnd in the meantime I'm here waiting for a federal EUHotNow that's a different thing tbhSomeone watches CGPGreyHaha yeaWay more constitutionally and democratically soundFrom what I get about the US yeahAlthough as of now it's also extremely buerocracratic and gridlocked by politicsBoth internal, external, geo and localBut we can do better*pours some bleach in a bowl of tide pods*Although as of now it's also extremely buerocratic and gridlocked by politicsTide pod cerealI like the concept of the eu but yea rn is kinda bad because politics and moneyPart of a complete breakfastI wonder how a cooked Tide pod smellsNo plzThe hell started this Tide Pod death trainI think just how fruity they looked and someone cooked a tide pod pizza for funsies so now we're stuck with this memefurrieshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM6wanZOLtkI think thisNiceAustin/el paso areas would become california 2 and the rest would kinda

Neither were in a gang, but they hung out at the bars.I like Triumph motorcycles tho, because the Street Triple is the sexiest looking bike I have ever fucking seenSameeeeee, at least for me it fluctuates so much I hate it. Like one week it's relatively deep and then the next it's high, gahI found someone phone outside by where I lived and they called and they came and picked it upI need to learn music theory to improve my vocal game.Im trying to get mine to be high tbh. But I also dont want the high pitch screech just a more girly voiceI've had mine look like that, but longer but I feel yawhen you're going for a girl voice, it's not really about pitch, it's about r e s o n a n c ebecause there are women who speak in the same register as a man, but their voices are still noticeably femaleOh whats thatsame with men who have high voicesI guess my voice fluctuations are also due to the fact that I don't know what I want my voice to be lolLmao I get itthe quality in a sound of being deep, full, and reverberating
Basically a fancy way of saying men speak with a different part of their body than womenYou can choose your voice?Are you telling the admin to get outtaYou can train your voiceMen tend to speak from their chest but women tend to speak from their throat or like
not the chestWell I'm only 12 and going through puberty so I feel like I have more control over how it comes outI think I'm still the worst of us allDe boobies?YepI'm 12 and what is this?There's a Reddit dedicated to voice training for this stuff, want me to link it?How do you get big female boobies irl?:(Yeah this is what I'm doing rn essentiallyPleaseeeeeeeeee1. pad your bra

"Femboy" is a delusion, a made-up word that these mid-teens think is real, and have begun calling themselves that to get attention. 
There's twinks, and there's traps. There's no magical unicorn "femboy" in between. Ever notice how people start grasping at straws and changing the definition of what a "femboy" is whenever their existance is challenged, and how everybody's definition of what a "femboy" is, is different? That's proof enough that it's made-up. "Femboy" is a gross, abused, and completely fake term, and so-called "femboys" are the culmination of some of the worst things about attention-starved teenagers combined. No-personality, all-slut, cookie-cutter garbage, who got the choice between "twink" or "trap", but chose both instead, like the spoiled brats they are.Its literally a term for someone who dresses like a girl to trick guys into fucking themCuntboi?file.sticker=CAADBAADGgEAAurkBwVIdGMhtraMdgIfile.sticker=CAADBAADbwMAAgzIjQWDiqZ1BDDdNgILmao someone doesnt like femboysMeWhat do you have against fembois?Their hardblush wannabe personalities.TrueFemboys are hawt af at leastTo make up for their lack of...

"Femboy" is a delusion, a made-up word that these mid-teens think is real, and have begun calling themselves that to get attention. 
There's twinks, and there's traps. There's no magical unicorn "femboy" in between. Ever notice how people start grasping at straws and changing the definition of what a "femboy" is whenever their existance is challenged, and how everybody's definition of what a "femboy" is, is different? That's proof enough that it's made-up. "Femboy" is a gross, abused, and completely fake term, and so-called "femboys" are the culmination of some of the worst things about attention-starved teenagers combined. No-personality, all-slut, cookie-cutter garbage, who got the choice between "twink" or "trap", but chose both instead, like the spoiled brats they are.YEEEEEEEAH I FOUND IThere's the copypastaRemember to credit the author. >:(meamMe?Hentai doesn't exist, you either watch porn, or watch cartoons, hentai is cookie cutter Japanese cartoons with boobs added inI take creditthis will be the first time that I've ever saved a text file in my meme folderWelcome.I mean, we witnessed an amazing copypasta before our eyes.file.sticker=CAADBAADaQEAAip6whJmRM_nJoSNwwIMy truth is being saved to numerous harddrives.Soon, all shall know the truth.PSA: Do not credit Marstan, he does not deserve creditAnd it will be bored deep within your hearts.And you know it to be true.I'm gonna wipe that shot like my last name is ClintonI'm gonna wipe that shit like my last name is ClintonBut do you have to be an asshole though?

Udinanon: NK doesn't want war, it wants only the threat

Supreme Leader Lil Thi...: My button is bigger

Hand Polio : Personally, I dont think we are going to war soon, but if we do, N.K would be blown off the face the world

https://refind.com/l/cad60dd741Also I found this interesting and lengthy article about the new power relationship between China and Trump's USAF U C KI'm honestly kinda hopeful China will complete One Belt One RoadWhat's that?The only thing I know about China is how horrible and dystopian the Sesame Credit system ishttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Belt_One_Road_InitiativeAnd it's probably not even the worst thingMan do I love sesame seedsThey use facial recognition to track people in the street
They also use it to stop people from stealing toilet paper from public toilets
Or from jaywalkingWoah!! I hope this happens before the mandotorization of SC._.Xi Jinping is taking China into the world stageHe's honestly my favorite world leader of todayYeah, I don't think I'm happy about itWhy?That plan is good, but it doesn't excuse the existence of Sesame Credit.He's rapidly modernising the country, and belive it or not two superpowers is actually more stable than onehttps://youtu.be/lHcTKWiZ8sISesame Credit:
- possible punishment in 2020 for low "obedience" scores, like slower internet and refusal of certain jobs
- incentivizing the ostracisation of friends with low scores
- an inexpensive re-educatuonal tool with low chance of revolt amongst citizens within the systemEh, I'm not sure about itChina is basically fascist tho, and the current administration is doing nothing to change thatNopeNo shit that two superpowers are better than one, but you need to accept that these superpowers are worse than your fantasies about them.Yes?+1Yeah exactlyIm agreeingBecause just one means that there is a huge chance of rogue nations developing *cough cough* Iran, DPRK, IraqI wouldn't go that far tbhBut
They are not niceIt's certainly idk fascisticWorse, they're not oppressive, but instead they encourage pinning citizens against each other to win out as "best citizens."The communist party if china has been experimenting with limited amounts of democracy and that's the current path they're heading onWorse, they're not oppressive, but instead they encourage the citizens to combat each other economically and socially against each other to win out as "best citizens."Also they are the ones pushing in stuff like basic research, technological development, biotechnology and others, basically making them leaders of the future before it comes
I don't want a  full blown authoritarian government controlling me at every step*cough iran is only a rogue nation because the u.s. forcibly ostracized them from the global community cough*+1Wow my lungs are weirdThe funniest part is that western nations established the current government of IranWhere is the democracy? Where is the freedom of speech? Between the great firewall, censorship, social credit, cultural manipulation and abolition of many baisc human rights I see no docracy or freedomHeck all of those "rogue states" and their crappy politics can be traced to actions taken by the USAGotta love the US establishing pro-west fascist puppets everywhere'80s CIA memesAnd that government disagreed with them

Seems a bit like exaggeratingHahahaI know the alphabetHahahaHelloHalloI need to debate somethingHiYou mean you have a specific topic?Any suggestions?Guten Morgen!Transgender childrenDamnWell I mean I guessGender doesn't exist so neither do transgenders, child or otherwiseOh come now that can't be to tabooInteresting topicI think that there should be no transition possible for kids under like 16 unless it really endangers the kid's life and if more than 2 psychologists agree about the problemGender does exist but that is not the topic I preferNo Im saying we havent talked about sexuality much here, Im willing to debateHeheThen children should be able to express themselves however they wantI mean I dont care if youre transgender or not, doesnt bother me, but I think the children should be more educated about sexual identityTransgender people should get help I think it is due to an imbalance and letting a child ruin their body with hormones and surgery or hell even letting someone 21 years old do it is pushing it for mePersonally I'm a factual person, so I belive that gender dyshorphial is a mental disorderSee, this chat wars thing is the kind of game I wanna make but fUCKIf you are just talking about kids wanting Barbie's or GIJoes then you should just let em have whatever they wantWHY DIDNY I THINK OF IT FIRDTWHY DIDN'T I THINK OF IT FIRSTNot at allBut a lot of the time when children make these kinds of decisions they end up regretting it later.Hence my pointAnd its really hard to reverse that kind of thingsSo? Everyone has their emo stage or their preppy stage or whatever. Everyone regrets those too. Should we prevent teenagers from listening to My Chemical Romance to prevent them from eventually regretting their emo stage?^I see in stats the suicide rate of "transgender " is almost exactly the same post transition or notI never said hormones or surgeries for children. Those are health issues regardless of ethical issues of liberty.A stage that will likely have very permanent consequensesWhy would a 21 year old not be able to decide upon itself?You're comparing two unlike things, the emo stage usually doesn't directly affect the rest of your life. A sex change doesThe brain is still developingHard questionI never said hormones or surgeries for children. Those are health issues regardless of ethical issues of liberty.They do get helpDonald j trumpThe accepted medical position is that transition is the only optionJynx is a v strong conservativePretty litI agree, if you are 21, you should, and make decisions for yourself, but if you are like 10, you need to be more educatedThen you should not have any relevant decisions in that period, but you do
You choose highschool, college and much more even before being a legal adultShould be treated as a mental illnessIt is.Not really most situations they are humoredYeah it's what I said, but I say 18 as I don't understand why you should get stuck even if you are legally an adultI don't think that that should be a thing until you are old enough to have rational thoughtI dont have an opinion on this, but why do you think thisNo.
You seem to have a misunderstanding what a mental illness is.Soo never?
Or at 18It is a condition to be treated.RightThe only way for it to be treated is transition.18 or 21You don't like it, I can tell
But you aren't a doctorI know they can be treatedAn actual, medical doctor would tell you you're wrong.I was diagnosed with aspergersI still know I can be treatedAnd that makes you an expert, huh?Depending on what you think of rational thought. When you are capable of logically voting or capable of safely consuming alcoholNoI'm trans, friend.Good for youI have been to hell and back with this side of psychologyGood for youGood for youI'm saying I have an understanding of how the medical process worjsRemember, no adhominHe, evidently, doesn'tNot to be rude.And I do not believe that underaged people should go through thatI'm not claiming to be an expertI would still leave room for wiggle if multiple psychologists and psychiatrist think that transitioning would help with the mental health of someone under 18Remember, no adhominemAt all.
But he's making assumptiobs that are actively harmful to people with mental issues.At all.
But he's making assumptions that are actively harmful to people with mental issues.Being one myself?Yes.Having hope my situations can be treated?Doesn't make you less likely to do it.My situation is treated.You just don't like it.But statistics sayIt's not about safely consuming.

but again, there have been very, very few cases of people "regretting" it.>what is anectodal unsourced dataI think there's definite health risks but at the same time many young children can already pass as any gender just by a haircut or clothes, and transitioning doesn't always involve hrt or surgery. Pronouns and appearance are probably going to be enough of a transition for most transgender children, and if medical treatments can be proven reversible and harmless to development then they should be available to children as wellCall it natural selectionhttp://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/12-year-old-boy-trans-female-change-mind-years-later-patrick-mitchell-australia-oestrogen-hormones-a7933741.htmlOne kid.This is about one childvs. millions of others.ExactlyThis must be one hell of ChildThe death of millions is a statistic the death of one is a childThey're CHILDREN.

But don't punch syndicalists, don't punch anarchists, don't punch libertarians and don't punch conservativesTfw making shit upUm what is socialismIll only punch someone if they punch first.Collective ownership of productionCan be through a lot of waysSocialism

Political ideology

Socialism is a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production, as well as the political theories and movements associated with them.Wikipedia

Founder:Karl MarxDemocracy (i.e. unions) is the best oneOh dear what's happening:^)Yep.
It leads to communism.Being a Nazi is itself hurting people, or at least working towards hurting people. If a boulder were being pushed towards a cliff with a large population at the bottom of it, you would do what you could to stop the people pushing it. The boulder is state genocide, the ones pushing it are Nazis spreading their ideas, voting, etc. I'm not using this as a justification for all violence, but rather the principle of antifascism, which is to stop fascist/genocidal/Nazist beliefs from spreading and/or having influence on government action. So it has to be case by case whether individual physical violence is justifiedI just avoid the term because it's associated with authoritarians.Communism is supposed to be DemocraticAnd authoritarians should be punchedOh and Nazis were socialist^They weren't tho...Actually they were economically centristOk. Doesn't mean socialists agree with themThey were roughly the equivalent of germany's economy todayOof it truActually it's supposed to be anarchistWoo fuck the euMix of private and public ownershipUmAnarchy is inherently democratic thoanarchist or at least anarco capitalist is all private ownedNot in the sense of following the ideals of the Dem party thiNot in the sense of following the ideals of the Dem party tho._. watAnarcho-capitalist isn't anarchist :PPrivate corporations are governments+1It isn't but I'd be the guy selling guns in a war to both sidesYou mean the winnerThat's how shit works.
Unions are governments, towns are governments, etcThe EU will collapse in years to cineNope. Capitalism (private ownership of means of production) creates a class hierarchy (rich bourgeoisie over poor proletariat) where one has power over the other. The rich constitute a ruling class. Anarchism is defined as a society without rulers, and thus must be opposed to capitalismAnarchism itself is kind of a misnomer tbh
As the people are a governmentThe EU will collapse in years to comeI wish but nahToo stablrYeahToo stableThisNo it's notNeoliberalism will win:<It truIn europe at leastHalf of the EU countries want to leaceHSSSSSSHalf of the EU countries want to leavwHalf of the EU countries want to leaveLooking at you Clinton's...A government without rulers tho.

The maps you post take the rates they report, which are subject to various laws about what counts as rape and what rapes count for the national stats. Ik Lucy had sources on this in another debateThose already existOne possible point is rape butttttttt"Differences in reported crime across countries are usually related to different reporting rates by victims (and/or detection by the police). Also different definitions of criminal offences by countries, and different counting rules, make comparisons difficultaccording toEnrico Bisogno,the chief of data development and dissemination at the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC).

When a woman comes to the police and says my husband or my fiance raped me almost every day during the last year, the police have to record each of these events, which might be more than 300 events. In many other countries it would just be one record  one victim, one type of crime, one record, Klara Selin, a sociologist at the National Council for Crime Prevention in Stockholm,told BBC.

In 2005, Sweden broadened its definition of rape. The word rape can since then be used to record acts whichwould be called assault or bodily harm in other countries, according to The Local.That led to an increase in the number of rapes reported in the country in the years following the law change.

In Sweden, women are encouraged to report rape cases. It appears, TheIndependent writes, that it is possible that in other countries there is a far stronger stigma around reporting rape than in Sweden.

In fact, rapewas down 12 percent in Swedenin 2015  the year the country received a record 163000 asylum seekers  compared to 2014. In 2016 it increased again  by 13 percent but was still lower than 2014."::^^))Well you seem confident but where is the link with imperical evidenceWhat I see is a big claim with no backupleg so hot

It's far less stigmatized to come out as having been raped.So you believe in guilty before proven innocent,mSo you believe in guilty before proven innocent?Well, for statistic purposes sweden records at the time of reporting which most countries don't doWhich it shouldn't beNo :P

I'm sorry for that.But it *is* possible to make life easier in those areas.Not by giving hand outsOr cutting police funds for said handoutsWell i was gonna say without handouts but if you wanna go there ;3Here anyone remember the battle of berkly?Oh absolutely
What we need isn't cutting funds, it's reprioritization and demilitarization.Integration of the police into the community does wonders.Neigh not with Detroit the police there have no powerWorks in St. Louis.Just like the mayor of berkly said nah bro let the rioters fightfile.sticker=CAADAQADLwADCRdFCeB6KoRtPHYiAgLike, there are a metric fuckton of laws that shouldn't be enforced and as it is the police *do* act as pseudo-military.And the people shouldn't fight themBut unlike a lot of hard left people, i think the police can do good things.First step is building trust again.They need to be accountable for their actionsNo more tanks and no more ARs.^Can you show me the proof of tanks?That wasn't the 60sIt was hyperbole, ikikBut they *do* have super-expensive military surplus gearSuch as APCs or suchWell if they don't have their shields and batonsAnd APCs?And there, again, is the matter of accountabilityThe APCs they use are about 500000As it is they rarely are prosecuted even when they do commit crimes.(They don't need APCs at all)And that's if they aren't shipped straight from the militaryIt's partially the attitude of having themYes we all seen riotsHaving an APC deters thatLook I live in utahRiots are nearly always for a reason
Addressing the issues is vastly preferable to deterrance through intimidation.A reason like blmOr a probable causeG I m m eLike a kid getting shot for reaching in his pocket?Both
The former, even in cases where it was justified, displays an underlying distrust of the police force.
That can be fixed.
The latter is way more straightforward.Or even betterI hate people who use race but it's trueAgain, folks need to bridge the gap between "police" and "people"Yes they doBut we should do it graduallyNot just take all the protection awayI have great, huge, probably pseudo-authoritarian but i stj i'll figure that part out, ideas about some kind of civil service and democracyBut anyways i got shit to do y'all have a nice dayIsn't protecting them civil serviceI'm against mass publicized thingdI'm against mass publicized thingsA man was shot today is what they should sayBut what they do sayA black father of 3 was shot by a police officerAnd everyone loses their shitOkay lunch time was funDamnit LukeI'll just PM just in casewanna pmnonot you hakcerInflatable buttplugs are a thing y'knowfile.document=CgADAQADGAADhWCxRfo5pXG4u9BsAgYall didnt see nothingYofile.sticker=CAADAgADGwADmuzlEVrDXxQPmFv3AgAnyone wanna see my art?BeautifulDankeAlso khajiitLol what does that have to do with JewsI prefer AjitNoYea no one doesI'd rather not ajitAjit has internet if you have coin@Stumblinbear disagrees with reasonsIf you got the coinnnn, we got the net, internetAjit pai is dadAre you an Ajit Paier.?We must crucify them Deus vultKind ofYes or noWhat's an Ajit PaierI dont knowIm just fucking with peopleWell fineI've never had tobleroneI want to thoYesMe neither, but I don't really care to, tbhNo uWhyd he leaveIdkAsk him/herTheyre not very goodTried cleaning my screen, Woopshahafile.document=CgADAQADFwADSpKBRtpPaXg9yKJoAgStar Wars stories in bandCan I come down?I hope Ajit one day rises to be world monarchfile.sticker=CAADBAADQwQAAvmoPAxvbR66LuKI2AIIf this was LA Noire, I would hit the doubt buttonWhat?Can I jointhe mom looks like she's about to snap in the second panelI thought that was obviousfile.sticker=CAADBAADIAQAAvmoPAxk9VqfDFWVRwIalso I know a cat-kin person irl and ughhhhhThankfully, the worst case I know is a gender non binary demisexualAt least it's not as badgender is weirdthe human brain is a wacky-ass machineThere are only 2 genders yoThere are no gendersOnly two sexesI'm fine with non binary people, believing you're an animal is where I draw the lineIs transhumanism ok?no because that's physically impossible

Maybe for some it's full of unrest but some others perhaps don't mind what's happening around them.AlmondsTurns me on cause almond milk=nut juiceHmmmmStill it's a one-sided guessAlso if I recall there's this news on your screenshot about the guards claiming victory against anti-government protestsGilbert GottfriedPringlesWhat about...Iran's Revolutionary Guard said Sunday that the nation and its security forces have ended the wave of unrest linked to anti-government protests that erupted last month.

In a statement on its website, the Guard blamed the unrest on the United States, Israel andSaudi Arabia, as well as an exiled opposition group known as the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, and supporters of the monarchy that was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Price hikes sparked protests in a number of cities and towns late last month, and at least 21 people were killed in scattered clashes. The protests, which vented anger at high unemployment and official corruption, were the largest seen in Iran since the disputed 2009presidential election, and some demonstrators called for the overthrow of the government.

The Guard is a powerful paramilitary force loyal to the supreme leader, AyatollahAli Khamenei. Many of the demonstrators protested against the Guard's massive budget, its costly interventions across the region, and against the supreme leader himself.

Hundreds of people have been detained since the protests began. They include around 90 university students, reformist lawmaker Mahmoud Sadeghi was quoted as saying by the semi-official ISNA news agency.

'Falling apart?' Trump's insults not forgotten in Atlanta

1h ago

Iranian lawmakers held a closed session on Sunday in which senior security officials briefed them on the protests and the conditions of the detainees, the state-run IRNA news agency reported.

"It was emphasized that foreign elements, and in particular the United States, played a basic role in forming and manipulating the recent unrest," IRNA quoted lawmaker Jalal Mirzaei as saying.

The United States and Israel have expressed support for the protests, which began on Dec. 28 in Iran's second largest city, Mashhad, but deny allegations of fomenting them.

In recent days, government supporters have held several mass rallies across the country to protest the unrest.Source: ABC NewsHe's hot thiHe's hot thoVeryOh noI might invite him to a threesome ;3If the US starts to supply the rebels I think we could see the end of Iran as we know itdoubtBust a fat nut all over that shell~Okay I'm doneI'm sorrythat's so damn lewdmy eyesare burningthe us is actively trying to get out of that shitStop Harvey weinsteining my turtleCute Ikrfile.sticker=CAADAQADOAwAAiPdEAazgAnYDw-9BgITortoise*21 people killed in clashes.

I hope you enjoyed the Telegram product updates this December. Stay tuned  we are going to make 3 big announcements in January.

On a less joyful note, Iranian authorities started blocking Telegram in Iran today after we publicly refused to shut down channels of peaceful Iranian protesters, such as @sedaiemardom.

We are proud that Telegram is used by thousands of massive opposition channels all over the world. We consider freedom of speech an undeniable human right, and would rather get blocked in a country by its authorities than limit peaceful expression of alternative opinions.

When it comes to freedom of speech, Telegram is as unrestricted as a mobile app can get. In 2015, after Apple and Google reached out to us in the aftermath of the Paris attacks, we added the simplest Terms of Service theoretically possible in an app: no calls for violence, no porn and no copyright infringement on public broadcast channels.

Since then, Telegram has been blocking hundreds of violent public channels daily (including those reported in @isiswatch), making sure our rules are applied equally and fairly to all players, regardless of their size and political affiliation.   

Yesterday we had to suspend @amadnews, a public channel that started calling its subscribers to use Molotov cocktails and firearms against police. The admins of the channel reached out to us after the fact, apologizing for breaking our rules and pledging not to promote violence in the future. As a result, they have been able to reassemble most of their subscribers (800,000) in a new peaceful channel, which we welcomed. 

Obviously, our neutrality and refusal to take sides in such conflicts can create powerful enemies. Iranian officials have filed criminal charges against me back in September for letting Telegram spread uncensored news and extremist propaganda. Today they imposed a block on Telegram  not clear whether permanent or temporary.

And yet, doing the right thing is more important than trying to avoid having enemies. Were extremely lucky to have been able to consistently apply our principles in 2017. We will continue doing it in 2018  and beyond.Anyway, good morningfile.sticker=CAADAQAD4wAD0CxwBdxcaCdFdQuzAg What are you?

But even then, to deny people the right to vote in decisions that directly affect them simply because they can't provide identification is completely unjust.file.sticker=CAADAQADVgIAAgOwqgZWVI64UJtd1QIMlemI myself think that voting is a two-sided knife. Vote for the wrong one and we'll get a nasty leader. Not voting means something not good. Voting for someone right is a dilemma in itself.That said, I've never voted myself.The identification is to prove that they are supposed to be voting.Me neither.
Travel to Indonesia to find a bunch of likeminded politicians all aiming to enrich their own party by becoming a political leader or so.Are there any punishments for not votingmAre there any punishments for not voting?NoNicefile.sticker=CAADAQADGQADwbN3DiRjWoCUSKpvAgThe point is to ensure they're a citizen of the stateThis year's gonna be a big deal. Public election for executive and legislative representatives of cities, regents, and provinces throughout Indonesia all takes place this year.And are eligible to vote, aren't it?That as well*gasp!* Mlem!Define "supposed." If we're talking about people that have already voted, I would agree that they shouldn't be voting again because that would provide them a disproportionately large voice. However, cases of voter fraud like this are almost nonexistent compared to the total pool of voters, so it doesn't really justify identification laws. However, if by "supposed to be voting" you are excluding, say, illegal immigrants or people technically under the legal voting age, then I'd entirely disagree since these individuals are still voting in decisions that directly affect them. I believe that if an action affects a certain group of people, then it is only just that every member of that group gets a say in whether or how to go about implementing that act.Florida issues a voter ID to everyone when they get a drivers license, currently. Sanctuary cities are giving illegal immigrants drivers licenses, it is their job to either not vote or revoke their own voter ID.

Yeah rightCriminals that are not a citizen of the state should not be voting.They have no legal right to vote in a nation they are not a part ofHere they are required and I don't really see why not, it's just a price of paper they mail you when you become 18 and you have to bring when you go votingSounds complicated.Goodnight everyoneSame here, but we're supposed to be either 17 years old in age -or- have married before 17 years oldI'm an anarchist. I don't give a shit about arbitrary, state-defined "legal rights" :PSame here, but we're supposed to be either 17 years old in age -or- have married before 17 years old before we get voter IDs and stuffNight!So should I grab a couple friends, walk into your house, and demand I have a say in what you do with your paycheck?/This implies that terrorists and people with no clear nationality are not allowed to vote. Am I right?So should I grab a couple friends, walk into your house, and demand I live there and have a say in what you do with your paycheck?Not legally, however Florida is giving out voter IDs to illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities.Terrorists might be citizens, doesn't stop them from votingNo. Like I said, only people that are directly affected by a decision should have a say in its execution. Since the way I spend my paycheck (to play along with the example) doesn't affect you or your friends, you don't have a say in such matters.You're right at that pointBut I'm eating your food, and you're buying the fod(oh, sorry, didn't see your edit)But I'm eating your food, and you're buying the foodTherefore I should have a say in what you buyThat is rather complicatedWell to say it doesn't it's reductive, every action you take has implications for the people around you and even people far awayIf such a voluntary arrangement were created, then yes, you would have a say in how the money is spent.Should you be able to spend monet in ways that endanger me? If I'm your neighbor, should you be able to build a nuclear reactor near my house? It's your paycheckNot voluntary. I broke into your house.I'm imagining how this topic would be in a socialistic, aristocratic, or even monarchy countriesIn the latter two there is no votingIn the first the discussion might be very similarThat's why I was imagining themHow do you imagine voting in a monarchy?Like, since they have no voting and stuff, how they'd deal with their people's aspirations and allDepends on the type of society, in feudalism there was no concept of social mobility so aspirations were not a thingUnless you were the son of someone important enough and you had powerAlso its worthwhile mentioning that in feudalistic societies, those power can also derive from kinship privileges and stuffMeaning that when you're born the son of a great king, you're getting VVIP access to almost anything in the feudal landAnyone here have pubgThat is assuming, however, that it is "my" house. Now, to take this example literally, it would indeed be "my" house in some sense. Everyone should have a domicile that they can live in and feel safe from the intrusion of others. However, this is a need of an individual, and since I understand that this example is supposedly analogous to immigration, I will point out that I deny that the same logic extends to an entire country of millions of people. There is no need to have a distinct, pseudo-arbitrary piece of land that we can call "ours" and feel safe from intrusion. Such a division is unnecessary on that scale. Borders should be non-existent and international travel and immigration as easy and free as interstate travel and immigration.If you do add me on discordhelowohttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/08/parliament-staff-made-24000-attempts-view-online-pornography/My favorote color is lellowOn a completely unrelated news, this chunk I found made me smirkOh UKSo hypocriticalPlease changeMy favorite flavor of popsicle is dick>no pornhahaha

He has also denied claims that he touched a young political activist on the knee, saying the allegation is "untrue and deeply hurtful".

HOW THE FUCK IS TOUCHING SOMEONES KNEE INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIORI'm reporting some bots. Thanks for confirming that bots may also be processed for takedown requestsSuch as?>reporting porn bots
But WHYIKR like what the heckGotta comply with apple app guidelinesDepends how you do it, if you are in a car and someone grabs your knee while using sexual innuendos it's not appropriateAs for me, some copyrighted contents and indications of underage pornDo you kno da wey?Oh ok those can be valid reasonsNot really though. You can just say 'fuck off' and not report the bots in order to support greater sexual freedom, expression, acceptance, and enjoyment.In general yes but cases like underaged content should not be left onlineBut when it comes to indications of underage porn, I think an investigation would worth the try. If its indeed underage, I won't mind it being taken down. Bots are public afterall, or so I think.Well yes but telegram has to take them down to complyI'd agree with that. But to unilaterally ban pornography is unjustified and I don't support it.Never said I support it, I'm all for freedom of sexual expression etcAlso in private channels you can post whatever you wantIt's public channels that are the no-noIt's public channels that are the no-nosI know.

You guys know LINE? It's a social media service by Naver.
They have this LINE@ Official Accounts thing where everyone can create 'official' accounts (which functions much like Facebook's Fan Pages). I've seen many LINE@ Accounts posting artworks, memes, quotes, and et cetera from various sources.

Their viewers and followers rank up. Likes and comments keep coming to the account (like, if you want to like/comment/share the post you will have to follow the said account).

And then, the LINE@ Accounts offer endorsing services (paid advertisements). By requesting an endorsement, we can advertise our service/product through the said LINE@ Account. The more followers and viewers, the more expensive it will be.

Most LINE@ Accounts post artworks without the artist's consent. Talk about how they just 'found' it on google or other networks and post it on their account's wall.

What do you guys think about this?There is one thing we can agree on I bet, FUCK THE PATRIOTSI've seen some blogs with a bulk of advertisements on it. They feature artworks done by someone else. However, whether the blogs have permissions from the artist to post their work on the blog page or not--I don't know yet.file.sticker=CAADBAADNQQAAvmoPAx6I0RHGE1FtwIfile.sticker=CAADBAAD2AADM6-6ByT1diX5zOfnAgtraps aren't gayI'm indifferentfile.document=CgADAQADBQIAAk998QisGAkjgqjyTwIAlso, I've seen another case.

Just for a reference, an account with more than 100K followers will cost you around Rp. 1.500.000,- (around US$ 107) for one day endorsement.

So, like, those blogs got paid by advertisements.That is odd, I was pretty sure all of the AFC East fans that were non-pats agreed on that.p muchSamegood lord, that's not good at allhttps://www.youtube.com/user/AllTrapNationyeah I was thinking more some college student's Tumblr or Wordpress, not like thatthat's almost industrializedDamn, traps have their own type of music?Im in massachusets too muchAnd nycI can't hate a football teamLmao yupThat is the last place in the world I would want to be.Ironically, it happens often. Plus, on the note of the LINE@ Accounts thing, we have no options to report the said account.

A right is a particular liberty that is derived from human nature or morality or some other abstractionare you a fox as wellyou can only learn so much without risking life and limb.Ha, I disagreeTruI don't think I clarified this earlier, but the egoist views both the oppressor and the victim as victims of themselves as both limit themselves to abstractionsBy joining forces or being complacent to the will of the party in power, the oppressor limits their own ego.Egoism goes beyond material wealth, valuing liberty above all elseIt's a japanese word for a certain personality like Ryan describedEssentially a sociopathic stalkerSomeone's making a videogame about itWhere you're a highschool girl with a crush on a boy and the objective is to win his love by making sure that any other girls who likes your crush is dead or by destroying their reputation so your crush won't love them backWhere you're a highschool girl with a crush on a boy and the objective is to win his love by making sure that any other girls who likes your crushare dead or by destroying their reputation so your crush won't love them backWhere you're a highschool girl with a crush on a boy and the objective is to win his love by making sure that any other girls who likes your crush are dead or by destroying their reputation so your crush won't love them backThat remember me when I misspelled "no tengo eleccin" (i haven't election) with "no tengo ereccin" (I haven't erection) in a reading of a book.

What percentage of people, left of center, think that nazis should be punched.Are you denying that it happens?No. 
I'm saying that you're being dishonest for using a fringe group to apply to a whole group.By your logic, conservatives think gay people shouldn't be allowed in public.YayConservatives probablyBut not the right v:The entire right.You said conservatives :PYour logic, not mine friendoIt's shorthand. We both knew what I meant.Actually no. I don't equate the fight to conservatismtfw no one uses your name on 8ballActually no. I don't equate the right to conservatismwait noAnyways.
People who do advocate silencing hypernationalist/racist speech (via revokation of permits, societal pressure, etc) argue that their speech is inherently violent and dangerous to their fellow people.I've seen nothing but suppression from the left. Guns, speech, beliefsLemme get some stuffWhat?Guns, maybe.Is this not suppressing people's beliefs?And their right to free speech?There is a hierarchy to the rights we have as citizens.The right to life etc is higher than to speech.Imo.How is that relevantI WANT MEMESBecause, as I said, nazi speech is inherently against the life of others.So you agree that the left is trying to suppress things they don't believe inSounds hella fascist to mehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_toleranceSeen it before. I disagree.That's a flagrant misuse of the term fascist, for one.file.sticker=CAADBAADYwIAAt59GQzQXYJnvyLV_AISpecifically the "no tolerance for opposing opinions." Part.Two. 
Again, it's only for blatantly violent bullshit. 
And not through violence.Violence or no it's still suppression.You're conflating "advocating genocide" with "dissent"Wait shit this was sent here beforeHow do i make a picture into a file?What do I do if my memes are being stolen by other channelsThe position being held here is "folks shouldn't live in fear of being murdered".I'm all for surpessing opinions otherwise.I'm all for supessing opinions otherwise.Twitter is banning people from their site who visit sites they don't agree with, and will start shadow banning people who show "ways of talking" they disagree withI'm all for supressing opinions otherwise.That's not ok.Are they memes you're making, or getting from somewhere else?Twitter is run by zuckerbergian creeps.I make some but i don't even rly post the ones i makeWhat do you meanWhat kind of fileA folder?

While people should be free to say what they have in mind, that can be limited if they're calling for the deaths of others.Suppression of "politically right" speech is the only way they winOr you can rename the file sjidjfjd.png and it will open a converter that you may have installedI mean, I don't see supression in here anywherefile.sticker=CAADAQADMAADeaTmFsqUVWcOO47nAgTwitter is banning people from their site who visit sites they don't agree with, and will start shadow banning people who show "ways of talking" they disagree withNo, not twitterI meant the chat;PYou have been selected for the following question:

Pseudo-leftists who are entirely self-centered and only care about making young people think they're good.Sure, death threats fall under existing laws.No uWhere was I advocating for law changes? :PAnd the uneducated children who use it are tricked into believing the left is pure and perfect.Not reallyIt's neo-liberal bullshitNope making a sticker pack is too much work, lets all get evil applesMore centrist masturbationUse MediBangSee: teslaITS easyBy age 13 they'll be getting off to photos of spacex launches and amazon dronesNot reallyhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evil-apples-dirty-as/id645705454?mt=8Last five messages make absolutely no sense put togetherI'm pissed offIn relation to what they're responding toI'll clarifyThe main door of my house had been broken since yesterday night... All doorknobs and locks, broken. This morning came the locksmith and in 20 minutes he open the door.  He said: "the double-cilinder locks are bad for this days, with a simple wire the thives can be open the door, are the most "secure" by the double-cilinder, but this system has been discontinued. You need use the double-pallet locks is more cheap and a little worst than double-cilinder but is the most secure for nowdays."

This men can be excellent in the Thieves's Guild of T.E.S :PWhy?I don't like twitter/facebookOh they're both terrible. And yet you can't possibly see how suppression of political views on social media can affect how people see the world?Propogandistic shit. 
Like you said, they're forcing their ideals of corporate "leftism" on folks.You're making a lot of assumptions about my position.Was more talking about the difference between leftism and LeftMy telegram shit its self and sent me to the beginning of the chatMy telegram shit itself and sent me to the beginning of the chatThe stuff twitter and facebook are pushing is anti-democratic elitist tripe.I don't know about you but of the websites on the internet that suppress noone, no censorship, and ideas flow freely, are dominantly right leaningI don't know about you but of the websites on the internet that suppress noone, no censorship, and ideas flow freely, ive noticed are dominantly right leaningThe Taurs exist!The left, given the chance, suppress beliefs they don't hold.the issue is, right-wing beliefs are often extremely hostile to minorities. 
Be it sexuality, ethnic, religious, etc.Tis seen on subreddits, Facebook, Twitter, the many political apps on the app storeOh?Not you in specific.
Traditionalism.I.e. "society is fucking degenerate"Conservatives, you meanConservatives is to commies as right is to left, or however you're supposed to structure thatYou're saying you're in the bottom right box, yaLower center rightBut
What I'm saying is that when people are given free reign to say whatever they want, they say nasty shit.Yea David people are workingPeople saying nasty shit is not conductive to others feeling welcome.No uShut your god damned mouthNot on my christian server"Anti-censorship" places nearly *always* simply act as a safe space for racism, not some bastion of free thought.Oh boy this debateTaurs is just a cheap cheatcode for zoopiliacs who don't want to admit they're into zoophilia.So yes, leftism is inherently in favor of limiting what people can say.
But the things that they're limiting are things that make people feel uncomfortable or unsafe.
Not because they disagree politically.file.sticker=CAADAQADKwADXvSvELfeCigtMeuNAgI think there's a contrapoints video about this@Dragon_Ritnel is this an error message?I think it's a two parter actuallyBut wouldnt censorship make people more uncomfortableI read this in Jasper's voiceAnd twitter/facebook are corporatist shits who shouldn't existhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGTDhutW_usWhom?Jasper."Censorship" as in blocking racists from saying racist shit etcFrom Steven Universe.Whom'stYeah.You should still allow them to thinkI mean if you're a racist that probably makes you really uncomfortableWhom'st'd'veWhomstdntCensorship will only make it worsey'aintI mean, i'd estimate racists make up a smaller population than minoritiesWhich is why antifascism isn't about censorship and lawswhom'ba'bum'stNot in public chatrooms or anythingThat just makes the users more comfortableOk
So i feel like i haven't been clear enoughba-dum-tssI'm not arguing about laws or legislationanyone got some songs i should listen to on yt preferably 
Current And some 80's themed songs

Trying to get my con Playlist readyI hate that contractionLmaoI'm saying people shouldn't tolerate this kind of shit
And be more proactive in shutting it downhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4waCum4ZAMIt would make people more comfortable if they werent shut up if they had wrongthinkLoool

Then need no exist :PAnd nobody on the right does this either?As in, person-to-person
If you see racism or nazism, call it out and tell them to shut uphttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvD_SH-KQV4NahIt would make people more comfortable if they werent shut up if they had wrongthinkEvery political belief system will try to contradict and shut up their enemiesHere's something from to 80's

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQI feel like adding that just to fuck with peopleNot excusing it. Just saying that if we seek to truly foster free speech it's not a problem with the left or the right, it's a problem with our basic system of political identificationI personally think that censorship is the first stepping stone into authoritarianismI wholeheartedly support that notionAny moreI'd argue that that's way too late in the process to be the first stepping stone. The first would probably be social hierarchiesNot true, pragmatic groups encourage debate on issuesAgain, nothing worse than what we already have as lawsAh yes the enlightened centrist is hereJust yell at a racist 2k18We do not have any laws blocking out ideologies minus those that actually pose an active threat to civilians like terrorismGive people an inch and they take a mile.Censorship shouldn't be tolerated.Who wants to sit down and play a quality game of Snow White and the seven clever boys with me.Minority views will eventually disappearI too have seen that JonTron episodei like the black characterThese "pragmatic" groups encouraging debate often tend to be rather right wing and hate the left, saying primarily that the left hates free speech. If they debate these people it's usually just so they can "win." They shut down people who they see as opposing their free speech/logic approach, which is usually the left. So yes even pragmatic centrist pro-discussion groups act against free speech of their enemiesImma play it, every bit.You mean state censorship?That was the only 80's music that I know. Unless you want 80's thrash metal maybeNot justDoesn't have to be 80'sCensorship as a wholeThe internet is a new thing, hardly any laws made for it. Frankly, if you own a social media platform, censorship shouldn't be tolerated.I just want some music from that era (cons theme is the 80's)Would you critique and shame those that seek to destroy the lack of censorship?OoOoooOo this is a new directionIf you have resort to censoring your opponent, you lose.#endneoliberalism2k18So you want music from the 80s but it doesn't have to be from the 80s?but I still think that stopping harassment and such is importantAntifascist harassment?If you're being harassed, block them.if they're doxxing people or sending death threats yeah
but you see that a lot more from incels than anyone elseThe platform itself should not be censoring.DoxxingYou can straight-up ruin people's lives through the internetHaving a lassiez-faire system would be bad for user retentionThe block user button exists for a reasonWon't help if someone posts your IP and real name/addressFucking of course that shouldn't be tolerated, but I'm talking about censorship of "wrongthink"And you know itOk got it, wasn't sure how far you were goingFrom the government, sure. 
From the platform, sure. 
From society, no.You *did* say no censorship whatsoever"Whats the best bunker to buy to defend yourself from The attacking Furries?"
Answer:
"I don't know man, but invite me once you found one XD"Society can collectively block whomever they like. The platform should not.That's pretty niceYou're pretty niceYou areCool then we agree and you're ok with antifascismI actually agree here (beyond exceptional cases)Twitter blocking wrongthink is akin to a government blocking free speechOMG, Rhapsody of Fire AgreeWait, crap, I messed it upYa

The MMPR is the most famous of the adaptation?It's probably the most famous and it's the first adaptationMMPR even used one suit from the season after Zyuranger (Dairanger) and not the others ever because they were too afraid to change suits because they were so recognizable alreadySo they had to make more broken plot around the fight scenes which Saban bought from Toei to make it workfile.document=CgADBAADb58AAhgeZAfrlpzHka4DMQIOoh, but why he didn't changed the suits?It's like you drive your civic aroundand then one day you come home and see a honda del solwhy is there a different car?it's still a hondabut maybe some people don't like it as muchZyurangerand then Dairangerthey only used the white dairanger in mmpr everalso what languages do you speak by the way?just spanish/english?file.document=CgADAQADOgADi8uwRnKB060ldGE2AgI ned hnlephm?I need a name for the mining farm software ;-;Is the exactly custom of MMPR. That is the original?fug idkBefore Saban bought the footage to make MMPR, this is the source materialSpanish, and I use English for moments like that.

They fought against monsters like MMPR?yupyou hush you don't know the history REEEEEEEHow did you do that? o.oDug-it-upIdkI need to watch Gorenger one of these days despite it being so fucking oldif I can watch an anime from 79 surely live action tv from 75 won't hurtIdk the history but I do know that even modern Power Rangers basically can buy a tank of gas to do the explosions with per episode and nothing else. How low budget we talking here?Ok do you want me to give you the tldr between sentai and power rangersCopypasta maybeThe olds series are (in some cases) better than the nowadays series :Ptldr a jewish man buys fight scenes to a japanese show and has to make a teenager plot around the show with many plotholes and worse plot than source materialI can see thatBut the lennyface is linked as a username wtfI can do those faces tooOhI dont know thenSaban? MMPR?Y'all are weeaboo trashkillianwhat is your UM flagPower Rangers is ass compared to Sentai imoHaim Saban pretty much the guy who made power rangers a thingMMPR: Mighty Morphin' Power Rangersfile.document=CgADBAADU5AAAiUaZAcrn5EyOCtG-gIFucking hell this keeps happening.

I dont want Jackie to get poopdick, so yeah. Necessary hygienic precautions. Please DM me if you have spare Tide pods to share with a brotha. @lynxboi"Yes I do, they will be at the usual drop off point, I'm sure you can remember where that is.

Supreme Leader Lil Thi...: I think that they were violating his right to free speech and maybe even discriminating.

Bismark : He had every right to sue them, they basically were censoring him for no and taking away his rights as a U.S citizen

ThaZeus: I support him but legally cant sue, private companies have the right to limit free speech of their employees

Catloaf: I wish him best, but I doubt he'll get anywhere

Lucy is empathetic amn...: 1. Legally, google was free to fire him.  2. The attacks on non-traditional lifestyles in the lawsuit are laughable.

If you read his autobiography, A Man With A Whip, he relates a story about how he actually got his signature hair.

When he was younger, his father took him to the barber every two weeks. By the time Drumpf Jr. was 6, his father all but ceased to be a dad in every sense of the word. Jr. was left to his own devices. He missed his dad so much that he tried to find his way to the barber shop on his own. He vaguely recalled its location and had his personal maid walk him there; she reluctantly agreed.

On the way, the maid was assaulted by the South District Gang who were pretty active in New York at the time. As part of the initiation, they had to kill an innocent woman. With Drumpf Jr there, they held him down and forced him to watch as they brutally assaulted and raped the poor woman. They cut off all her hair and made her take turns fellating each of them. They even forced her to go down on the poor boy, scarring him for life in what he calls the single most riveting moment of his childhood. Drumpf Jr. goes on to recount how when they were through. They stabbed her to death and left her in the warehouse to die.

Still desiring to get a haircut like he used to, Jr. used the scissors they left to cut off all his hair. He then scalped his deceased maid and put her hair (what was left of it) on his head. Upon returning home, his father said he was proud of Jr. and so the man has been scalping women every two weeks and wearing their hair which he dyes orange ever since.^^^^^I will try to catch him for the wingsI'm personally unsure how i feel about it
Removing it assumes that there is no structural bias but it being there really does put less qualified candidates in at timesHire the best person for the job end of story.And free in some dark placeHire the best person for the job. end of story. full stop.It seemed to me like the arguments about leftward bias and affirmative action programs were separate, but I might be wrongYes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yesIf people of a certain group aren't in a certain field, they won't feel comfortable about trying to enter it.It's sort of a long-run type deal?Don't care. I shouldn't be forced to hire less qualified candidatesI shouldn't be forced to hire anyoneEverI don't know what the title of the video was so I'm not sure if I can find it again but it was mostly about college affirmative action, main point that got me was the idea that by accepting more students of minorities than would be accepted in a purely merit based system, the school accepts minority students that are below their standards, and students who the class is designed to be above. This puts these students into difficult classes that they aren't prepared for, and leads to them failing and wasting money. Affirmative action in this sense ultimately harms the education of minorities more than it helps. I'm sure the same logic can be applied rather easily to employmentIt'll be immediately beneficial to hire them, but down the line you might get better candidatesWoah woah woahouo it could carry rabiesHoly watDiversity quotas =! Affirmative actionThis is internal corporate politics :PBoth of them are stupidEspecially in google's case^Diversity quotas are a form of affirmative action, but they're by no means the same thingI don't see anything about it costing money...?

Peter Klimek, Raul Jimenez, Manuel Hidalgo, Abraham Hinteregger, Stefan Thurner - Election forensic analysis of the Turkish Constitutional Referendum 2017.

"We find systematic and highly significant support for the presence of both, ballot-stuffing and voter rigging. In 6% of stations we find signs for ballot-stuffing with an error (probability of ballot-stuffing not happening) of 0.15% (3 sigma event). The influence of these vote distortions were large enough to tip the overall balance from 'No' to a majority of 'Yes' votes."Thoughts on current Turkish government?fucking authoritarianssamerecep erdogan should be shot Especially when it's fresh from the ovenI'm fresh from the ovenI love fresh bunsI have fresh bunsI was making a joke about butts but that looks delicious tooExactlyEnjoy those bunsYes thanksBoopWell this is interestingEvery newbie fur everThought you could get away with it did you?

They were considered second class at one point, but they were never called thatBasically lolIm a hand niggerThey still areIrish lulEasy to say cuz you're british :UCan somebody pass the skin coloured crayon?Everyone is second class in americaWorking class is second class :\Everyone is third world in Australia.....you're not wrongSavageNo thats detroitAustralia is 0th worldDid the Australians hear about them peeps wanting to ban Australia Day?I hear about that every weekGood fuckin luck to those cuntsMeaning it's going nowhere?"Reeee your BBQ parties trigger me"R.I.P Columbus DayWell columbus day shouldnt be a thing cuz he didnt discover america.

Let's not acknowledge that these people aren't their ancestors, let's fucking guilt trip themOh, and give me moneylolmy family has a pretty detailed history being documented in the "edwards family cook book" i feel that pain all too wellexcept it takes place in WashingtonThe idea with that tho is to try and put people back on equal footing, where they aren't because of a history of second class citizenship. I'm fine with this, but the racial guilttripping is dumb?Not only do we have the people guilt tripping about race, we have people guilt tripping others about their fucking everything c:imagine the state turning to migrant norwegians and saying "look sell your boats and company to the natives or relocate to alaska"1962its when we lost everythingMost people in Australia aren't even related to the people who did the bad shit lolExactlyI mean...DON'T ASSERT YOUR FACTS AND PRIVILEGE ON ME WHITE BOIYou know what I really fucking hate?

Genuinely.Stinky cat u3uHawaii be likeLike hes only famous because durr i walked into the wrong room and made some jokes.Got anything else to share with those that haven't seen it?Oop, spoke too soonI didnt spoil anything. I just said he goes to a house and it has flashbacks to his mom as a kid. I didnt explain why he was there or what the flashbacks explainedEh..Its just my opinion.
But his theme song is an earworm i cant kick.Mr Peanut Butter diesI can only drramI can only dreamNo, I mean he actually diesNahToo soonIve seen part of the last s4 episode because my friends are assesYou fUCKERI was jokingNo shitI was talking yo Mr Peanut ButterI think Diane and Bojack should just be a thing. Mr PB should just fucking hang himselfI'm not that big of an asshole to spoil stuffAnybody that happy all the time just disgusts me.I guess im like Bojack in a lot of ways lolIt can be obnoxious when people are overly happy^Other peoples' happiness 6 times out of 10 gets on my nervesThe same thing can be said about being a narcissistic, alcoholic, drug abusing, depressed fuckwit like Bojack, but hey, that's what makes him a loveable characterBecause 6 times out of 10 im in a pissed off mood and dont need somebody rubbing in my face how great their day is going.-finishes his sip of Vodka- whadja say?{ Kiren Sirius Wolfe  }:

O.o ohnoIf there even will be a season 5 :pYes I didWhat makes him a loveable character is his cockThere willBut whai? Hes still cutelooking.

Running around as a bag lady while ruthlessly slaughtering people. I miss my childhoodFilled with so much video game  violence and happinessYes xD lolGames these days either overcomplicate things, use paywalls to block all of the fun, or just make thins overly simple and boring with the most intense graphics ever.Like..why make a game with such a pretty world that i cant even DO anything in.. IM TALKIN TO YOU NEED FOR SPEEDLike..why make a game with such a pretty world that i cant even DO anything in.. IM TALKIN TO YOU NEED FOR SPEED PAYBACKI never understood that either. Battlefront (2015) and even Andromeda are two that comes to mind that fell victim with that kind of thinking. It's beautiful, sure. That only takes me so far though.ExactlyThe "graphics" are only appealing to the new generation of gamers, and casual players.But to us.. people who grew up on the shit we had.. that shit doesnt matterSan Andreas was on PS2 and HAS A BIGGER MAP THAN GTA V!!Like, in GTA V they removed Las Venturas, the Badlands, the forests, San Fierro, like wtf.Its ONLY Paleto Bay and Los SantosThey replaced all of the fun stuff and exploration and items and sidemissions and fun events with... mediocre graphicsLike even for PS3/X360 GTA V's graphics arent the most impressive thing.So if its really a cut betweem budgetting for a prettier look or a bigger, more interesting world with THINGS TO DO.. you know what side i'm on.Also the only things theyre adding to GTA V are on the Online mode. Personally, i dont like GTA Online. Its cool but at the same time other people completely ruin everything for everybody else. Ans playing solo is..well MIGHT AS WELL JUST PLAY OFFLINE.It really gets old listening to people whine about graphics "ommmmgggggod it's not completely 60 fps, this game is garbage. DID YOU SEE THAT IT DROP A FRAMS 2/10."

 I was really disappointed when didn't add more DLC. I like GTA online, but only in small doses.

"Well, because I need an distraction from my lover cuz he don't want me and i dont wanna tell him how much i need him :("@KvlterTbh why let your boyfriend fap? Just do it for him thenI'm all wet"Will you fuck my man vagina and call me sexy"
Answer:
"Nah"You ok?You do know that for most trans people it's more about their identity being respected than passing, right?And that's all bullshitThe way people age is due to hormones, hunYou know
The easily replaced partAnd no. 
Plenty of trans folks pass.
I'm assuming you know there are ftm people too, right?Frankly you're just being an asshole with no real reason behind it"Need to wake up"No, that's just saying that whoever posted that will never socially accept usAnd that you won't eitherNo those are not argument, those are opinions
Also it's borderline hate speech tbh, it's very aggressive without a good reason and although it doesn't attack in a direct way is very dehumanizing and purposeless if not to express hate
Why are you posting it hereAs in, it's a social thing and self-acceptance, not looking perfectly female^LoooolIt's pointless, brainless viritolNothing I haven't seen before either, sweetie

Harder to sleep when digesting food.I sincerely doubt that will be an issueOkay yeah probably sleepThe problem is if I crash now I'l probably wake up at like 3 am. I can't be still jetlagged on tuesday, I need to go to my classesTrue.Then you know what you must doAlso I have real trouble sleeping when the sun is up, even if I'm this tired. No guarantee I'd actually be able to sleepI'd just suggest sleeping now because sleep debt ain't a thing, you can never make up sleep deprivation. It only compounds neurotoxins in the brain the longer you go without sleep.okOh, side note - last night I was hallucinating which was what made me get to sleep finallyArguments on any aspect of LGBT always seem to be the samewhat the fuckI know sleep debt ain't a thing, but if I sleep after dinner I should wake up at a reasonable hour for this time zone.

when properly managed, transition really does fix the whole situationOk noob. uwuWhat would you say to the studies I've seen cited (although, never linked) that say suicide rates are the same before and after transition?why would there be when transition worksDon't even talk to me. uwu*Talks to you*From here on out I will only respond to "Sir Dark Souls".But, aren't these in essence just means of achieving comfort? If your life is unstable, then you'll be uncomfortable. And greater technology should ideally lead to greater comfort, as when it is used to reduce necessary labor, or to entertain, etc. As for culture, I'd doubt its necessity, but even if we assume it to be needed it would also be a means of achieving comfort since without culture the person in question will be less comfortable with themselves and the outside world.besides people like you thinking it's grossthey're bullshitOkaySir fuck ballssee: never linkedKayLobotomies worked for epilepsy, but there are obviously better ways to fix it nowsuicide rates decrease markedly after transitionhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_igflevHbMthat's in no way comparableNew theme songThat's a false equivalentlobotomies literally kill peopleAnd a big oneEven if they are real and reliable I'd probably say it has something to do with the lack of social acceptancetransition makes someone look differentand feel better about themselvesyou just seem to hate the idea of people stepping outside social boundarieswhile i won't hold it against you as that's often pathological, you should seriously keep that in mindWhat game was he playing there?the remix doesn't link to the original videoI think there's something to be said for no u's points- research in the field is still very limited, and we may not be doing ourselves any favors by only researching technology and treatments for transitioning.

So
It's trashAnd I suppose that's part of why I'm... less than happy about people suggesting there are "other ways".

I really don't think you understand what you're talking about.Never heard of that eitherAdditionally.I just realised even tho my parents are split, they tell the kids off the same waySay some shitThen silence for 10 minutesAnd say more xDLike, boi, you got your point acrossYup :PAt least I don't get told off :3Am good boiBest boi uwu1. The reason I indirectly called you a bigot was because you're implying that the desire to transition is the disorder, not the discomfort caused, as noted here. That's entirely wrong as per the APA and DSM; your concern seems to ride not on making people healthy but on forcing them to accept their roles.
2. Your insistance that transition is somehow "not real science", whatt with putting it in quotations and saying it's "chemical castration" is another example of the above point; you're focusing solely on the destruction of the "true" body and not on actually meaningfully helping people.You're not arguing in good faith.AwwYour points are frankly offensive in that they're implying trans people are unable to make their own decisions.Your points are frankly absurd in that they're implying trans people are unable to make their own decisions.Are we done here?
Should I set a calender date you, seff, or that other fascist weirdo want to try and pull out viritol disguised as pseudo-science again?Oh this is the thing that most bugs me about these arguments against transitioning, it seems that people loose their right to self determination, even when their psychologist says it's a good ideaGay uwuSo, what do you think about facebook?I hope Zuckerburg gets nominated for president so guillotining will be far easierfuck him with a switchbladeYou're gayer uwuFuckYou might be right yeahI thought more about the service and the impact of social media and less about the personalities behind it but still I feel youI mean, I'm gonna move halfway across the world for my boyfriendzuckerburg is the personification of the service tbqh

Are you religious?Oh fuck those peopleNope. Classic atheist.I can be offended by being told what I can say. GET THATI believe in big dragon dickdragon dick is the opium of the massesExactlyayy new pfpniceYe, I got a real icon.I feel rebornAlrighty. So I've had this theory, but it's only based on my past experiences with religion/spiritualism, I used to be into wicca, shamanism etc.

Now this is just an observation, but my imagination is very vivid, to the point of where I can emulate sensations like "magical energy" and that made me wonder "are religious experiences psychosomatic?" I woulf like to hear your thoughts on thatI think I should make a personal trash meme pack for my own shitty nenesI think I should make a personal trash meme pack for my own shitty memesHiw high were you when you came up with that? That's some deep shitI wasn't high at allShameThere are unique patterns and a set description of religious experience to make it a certain phenomenon. Almost everyone reports them. They are covered, under all such spiritual things, by parapsychology.

I think psychosomatic religious experiences are perhaps possible. It might be that you are more susceptible to those sorts of feelings than others. A report of a sort of "magical energy" one can feel is also common enough to have some merit to be researched, though the scientific method makes researching these things currently impossible. We are getting close-ish with big data and bayesnian networks.My only spiritual experience occured under immense duress, and un-internalizable stress is often a source of various forms of psychosomatic conditions.For the record, I'm pretty much Atheist too. But now I use that imagination to project my thoughtsI can relate to thisI will say this, it lead me to have better meditation techniques to help me focusI've never had an experience I'd describe as spiritualnot to discount what others may have experiencedThe difference now, is that I acknowledge these psychosomatic happenings as not real and rather as a toolrightThat's just what I thinkI think that's validAnd it comes from being over someone telling me that I have "bad energy" because I don't feel like talking about goddamn fucking angels and angel guidance and angel encountersfile.document=CgADBAADNogAAlQXZAchcsz1rwIWGgIreminds me of how one of my cats drags himself around with just his front paws at like 1/4 the speed of light when he's spazzyHehehe x3this gives me chills owoxDWhy uwu*Squeaks*O.o loud fenfen in the morningMhmm!HiWhy can't I sit on Kat's D?Because it's his uwuI didn't ask uSo shushUwUI... oh uwuuwuuwuOwOOwU^w^*sits on kats D"Because only I touch the fenfen c:*hides*But what if I touch?And give him many many boopsAwwwwww yis!Adios to your ears :o*touches*file.document=CgADBAADaKUAArkcZAccDCH6AUngAAECFenfens Are So cuteThey are like an update to normal foxes :3But you'll be deaf :xIt's me when I'm given too much sugarAnd it's me when kris boops me uwuOwOfile.document=CgADAQADKAADKiwnCRyZX_EId0GlAg:3So far I'm notfile.document=CgADAQADHAADVAUZRWrTCF8FilxHAgGot a update on Dj SparxxYou are behind a screen :oShe has been stripped of staff and dj privelages at TFFWhat's happened?I wonder where I could get those gloves, never seen thoseDude i know like 9 percent of thoseDude i know like 90 percent of thoseLike what?WhyThreats and what have youRipThe only thing I dont know is the black bar at the very topMy fingers still hurt :vWaiUse a pick dummy xDThat doesn't help my left handWell you're gonna have to wait until you grow callousesThat's spelt rightI thinkI also need new strings because these ones sound 10 years oldGet nice strings uwuStop fingering your tailhole thenMy tailhole is nice and softAnd huuuuge OwOCan I pet itAnd perhaps sniffDonuts are betterBut you can't get grapefruit-scented donuts can youYou can uwuYeah you canThanks, I like sniffing your grapefarts uwuIs this Hexa's new business venture?If Hexa has a donut, it probably smells like grapefartsObviouslyThat's his entire existenceHe might actually be made out of grapefartsHe pisses grapefartsbreathes grapefartsLolWhy do you think his sona is purplemy school has a meme page hahaTHAT NERD STOLE MY MEMEOh god fucking hell againfile.sticker=CAADAQADwQADoYaHDn_UhWjSoF0lAgHe is a grapefartI need more alcohol before tackling thisMy little sister asked me If she could play the game where the courser is on [Unturned]SameIm like Fuck nouwuWhy do you think I'm purpleDeletDELETBecause you're into Hexa's scat?w--okay, maybe but I was purple before I even joined this chat c:Fart boysDon't kinkshameNot me thank fuckI'll fart on youYou won'tcareful with that wordPeople who are defensive about it, definitely are into ityou might attract some skunksI willI will fight youIt's true, isn't it?I'll bap youkinkyNo its fucking disgustingfile.sticker=CAADAQADOAwAAiPdEAazgAnYDw-9BgI^Kat won't give inKat is a closet fart boyfile.sticker=CAADAQADQwsAAiPdEAapcWnKBWuecgI^^file.sticker=CAADAQADDwADkvLtF7d9kP6k2kgaAgEw sergalsfile.sticker=CAADBAADoAADL0rzB0WkIE28G3dQAgY U C Kfile.sticker=CAADBAADvwADL0rzB6MXPHbgCv2YAgDo sergals have barbed dicksNoNo, they just have cancerNot in canon anywayYou can make one that has oneOne of my friends hate sergals, can't bare to see any sergal art eitherI dated a sergal, he was sweet uwuThey're like DADshalf are nice and half are genuine scumI mean, he did dump me at like 6am when I was asleep sofile.sticker=CAADAQADbC8AAq8ZYgdmDOYMtp_A1AIfile.sticker=CAADAQADxwADObDtBSLeTIcH54VnAgOh fuckMy finger must've slippedGet your finger out of your tailholeyou fag uwuWe wuz kangsbhkjbhlsdfbhjkasdfbhjadfasfasdfbhklsdfhbhjadjklsajklhfbsakujbdflikhjlsakdjblfkasdhvbhlgfblfkdjbslkhdclksabchxcbvdhklcsblhkvbolcdhsbkfjl vadsbhkldbdf hbssjkdbkfsdShell bug in SkyrimHow musky is Elon Musk thoughJust got back on telegram and I came back to this on my 8 ball...You have been selected for the following question:

If you do not know its a guy, its like schrdingers box. It could be either, but the perception is that it is a woman. But, in reality, its a guy. Therefore, it is both. The hidden trap is bi.

But, if it is seen, then because of the feminine appearance and the apperant lack of testosterone and abundance of estrogen in the body, it provides a half and half situation. Youre fucking a guy, but also fucking someone with an abundance of estrogen like a woman. The trap is bi.Traps are bi.

*shaking* o-o-okay, I I uh proved it wwwasnt a sssshitholeA newspaperFresh panda furCommunist skunkHar har@MasterPturdis I just watched the first two episodes and I have to disagree completely that it was in favor of the sexualization of Abi. I genuinely think the entire episode was meant as a warning against that form of society, with gruesome perversion being a sort of exaggerated form of the consequences of such a society. It's not meant to somehow promote, but it's a warning against the form of money centric empty lifestyles the people in that society led. I think this is especially evident in the episode's climax when Bing nears suicide on the stage while raging against this very lifestyle- Bing is the hero of the story, and that rant is essentially the moral. I don't think the episode is about Abi being turned into a porn star. It's more about, at least in my perspective, the transformation of everything real, including the plea for reality, being turned into another empty product by a capitalist systemI know it's wasn't pro porn but god damn the execution made me want to actually smash my tv.How so?Just the way they did it was so insultinThe whole entirety of the porn industry pisses me offIrl?

However, in this case, I am skeptical of some of the possible underlying intents and sbtle consequences of this action. Amazon has been seeing an increase of criticism recently given its poor treatment of workers for the sake of profit: long hours, low pay, control of bathroom breaks, etc. At the same time, Bezos has become the richest man in the world, and so a donation such as this would have an iota of impact on his wealth, but the media coverage of such a "selfless" act would help to indirectly change public opinion of amazon to be more positive, since Bezos, as owner of amazon, acts as its representative in the public mind. But, more than just giving amazon a better image, it also allows them to continue their abusive practices with less criticism.He's like a 100 billionaire so for him it's space changeI have a problem with people who want EVEN MORE by doing shit like repealing net neutrality and such"I hate anyone who makes more money than I do"Highlighted it for youand failing to implement mandatory paid vacation in the united statesOn face value, there's of course nothing at all wrong with giving people the opportunity to pursue a higher education without any financial barriers.

Maybe I'm just jaded.I'd love it if we could have an actual liberal on this subject come in and argue that nazism has logic, or that as illogical as it may be it can still be logically argued against, etc etcHmmmI actually find using logic is the best strategy when dealing with them.
They tend to just stop talking and or go away when they feel attacked.SureYay!Actual arguments don't often work with fascists. Fascism and related ideologies are based more on emotional appeal than any sort of rigorous scientific or philosophical basis. And I'm not just saying that as a leftist against fascism. Fascist ideologies have only a handful of theorists at best behind them. At the end of the day, fascism depends on constructed senses of racial, national, ethnic, and religious identity (specifically, adoption of such identities to the point of animosity  towards and exclusion of others). A random political argument with someone on the internet isn't likely to rid them of these deeply ingrained prejudices. Their best chance at this would instead likely be found in the encouragement and pressures of family members, ex-fascists, talking with experts who are trained in dealing with fascists, etc. The best thing that the average person can do, really, is just to reject such toxic people from their communities, rather irl or online, and physically protect those that fascists wish to harm if they can.If you kick my sides while riding you'll kick that sergal I just anal voredActual arguments don't often work with fascists.

Our universe created itself by its own volition, as did many others#aliensAlbert Einstein was a deist(An infinite number)That's what he's sayingCommieXDCould've been a front. Could've been real. It's more of a theory than anything else, but most deist critiques of the rest of Christianity are shared by atheistsHow could a universe create itself without a divine forceThat has nothing to do with communism!!I'm jokingXDScience says otherwise but I think God made the universe and the basic laws he made, created other stuff in the universeIt is the divine force, if you must put things into terms of divinity. If there were a "divine," I don't see any way you could reasonably distinguish what is and isn't divine- is the soul of a person divine? The soul of a community? What about the soul of a nonhuman sentience? A human nonsentient? Etc.How did all the matter in the universe create itselfGod made it:/It existed first, and then organized itself, and the principles of this organization created our reality with all its physical laws (three dimensions, gravity, etc.)Yes, yes I didThank you for the recognition I so rightfully deserveGod said "let there be matter"  it's a overlooked part of genesis XDLmaoBut how did it manage to come into existence though, that's my questionIt has always beenIt did not come into existenceFek youIt was always hereBut what started its cycle of existingI believe that a big bang happened but I do not understand how, without a divine entity being present that matter just started existing out of nothingNothing didAnd yet, something didTime/cause and effect are bogus in terms of this kind of thing imo- time is but a rule of the organization of the souls within our universe. Everything has always been how it is, and it never was. The stronger souls needed to organize weaker ones under them- like how quarks need to line up to white, for instance. The quarks can't ever not be white, so they never were anything but white. Same thing with things existing- it can't ever not exist as part of some stronger soul (a universe), so it always does, as a simple rule of how souls operate"coming into existence" implies there was "time" for it to not existWithout matter there is no timeHow does a universe just suddenly exist then.If there was no time, could anything exist?I mean it never could have not existedExactlyBecause the moment it didn't "exist" it existedBut what started the cycle of infinite existence other than a godWhat created the god?He has always existed, yes? Then you believe that something can always have existedTherefore, Occam's razor says it is impropable that a god created the universeYour logic of cause and effect is merely a product of your existence in this particular universe. There is no cause and effect outside of all universes. There's only the laws that souls operate by, and those laws necessitate this universe and every universe being tied up how they areTherefore you are gayCause and effect are dictated and only exist if there is time for it to existSo ur gayI think this message could easily be misunderstood- he's trying to say time has to exist for cause and effect to be a reasonable assumptionHellaWe're on the same pageWell, if time didn't exist before the universe did, then it was impossible for the universe to "come into being". Saying something came into being implies there was time for it to not exist, a time before it existed. Without matter there is no time, therefore the universe could not have "came into being" because that would require cause and effectI agreeWithout matter it is impossible for something to existI was just restating what you said because I didn't think you articulated it very clearlyYeahAlright coolIm hopped up on aspirin and alieveAnd it's lateSeff do you believe in soulsCollin will we ever actually rewrite the holy scriptures or will we just leave it?I'll rewrite it eventually.

 23 people voted so far.Oh okIn conclusion: cause/effect cannot exist without time. Time cannot exist without matter because time is dictated by matter. The universe cannot be created because that would require a cause/effect. Therefore it is oddly reasonable to assume that the universe has always existed as long as time has existed. Therefore the universe has always existed, as "always" assumes there is a time for it to exist.xDYepAnd now all we need to figure out is how time startedIt has alwaysWhere it started and well you knowThere was not a time when time did not existNoYesAs not existing would require timeTime existed as long as the universe- which is to say, time doesn't exist so asking how time existed is a flawed question. The universe exists in this space without time, and time exists as an aspect of this universe's organizational structureThe universe exists because it must. Because a time without time is not possible, time without matter is not possible, therefore time and matter have always existedTime exists as a result of matter and how it interacts with itself. The speed at which it may interact with itself is time.Although it's completely possible for there to be other universes with different concepts of time and matter- no time, or two dimensional time, or four dimensional space, or zero dimensional space and five dimensional time, or no time and no space and something we can't even conceive of instead...You cannot have time without matter. You cannot have matter without time. They are one and the same and require each other to exist.The universe did not "come into being". Because imagining a time before time is impossible.The universe did not "come into being". Because imagining or having a time before time is impossible.MhmBut is it imposible to imagine a beginning to time?A thing without time is conceivable I thinkThe exact moment the clock startedNot really. You cannot have a thing without a time for it to existTime dictates that the object is here and not thereAgreedThe object may be there soon, this is timeBut here and there are also dictated by space correct?If time did not exist, either the object does not exist, or the object is the universeAm I the only one who worries about the future more than current timeNo. Something "starting" is a change from it being stopped to going; from not existing to existing. Starting is like a motion from point A to to point B, and you can't make that motion if point A doesn't exist. You can't drive from Atlantis to Hilliard because Atlantis isn't a real place- in the same way, time can't have gone from not existing to existing because it never could have not existedSpace and time cannot exist without each other. Which is why it's commonly referred to as spacetineSpace and time cannot exist without each other. Which is why it's commonly referred to as spacetimeI would love to see what you're saying to get reportedNow, does space come before time or does time come before space? That is the question we must answerOh yeahOkAs time grows longer space continues to spread correct?Well not exactly but sureThey aren't cause and effect, that we know ofLooking in from outside the universe, wouldn't it be visible as all moments coexisting "at once," albeit without time? Can't we conceive of a 3D object, plus time, as a still four dimensional object? And then can't we conceive of the "place" we view it from as a "place" where time doesn't exist?Am I the only one who worries about the future more than current timeWhy worry about the future?It has already happenedtake each day as it comessameWe're discussing the concept of time as a wholeThe future has always existedWorried about failureHowCan you do anything to change it?Yes but I don't want to ruin my future and risk things in lifeAre you talking about the thing where all time is right now and the past present and future are all at once?More or lessI mean it's difficult to articulate but I think you have the conceptThen stop worrying. You are in control of your own future, and by that I mean you're going to follow a predefined path based on the initial existence of the universe and the interaction of chemicals in your head.

 37 people voted so far.Sounds about right tbhIf you want real value why even buy Bitcoin thenStill, I stand by my wordsHold bitcoin, and trade for other coins like cedex with real valuehttps://cedex.comYou cant get altcoins unless you have BTC......what?
They are diffenret networks, you can have ethereum and not Bitcoin.....what?
They are different networks, you can have ethereum and not Bitcoindammit that was my #1 spotNah jkAlike for most other crypto currencies, the only one linked directly to Bitcoin are it's forks which you can buy just by themselves, but if you had bitcoins before the fork you got some of the forked coins for free because it created a new network"I'm calling air support"- Alex ,the attack helicopterYes, of course. It is even better to have ethereum than bitcoin 
In fact coinbase charges you a crazy amount in network fees to send your btc to accounts outside of coinbase, without even looking at transaction fees....
The best thing to do is have assets in ethereum as its technology is stable and in my opinion, has a lot more value than bitcoin, then with lower transaction costs you can exchange it on binance or wherever you want for other altcoinsI expected this, to be honest, lol

MAy haps you have the other meme?Your money isn't any safer in fiat currencies.YeppersWell they are having quite a bit of problems, both with specualton and the fact that it's not actually decentralized, the fact that smart contacts are not as secure and as good as they advertise them to be, and the immsense hype behind the technology is not going to help it much, expecially with the massive crash of these daysMost of my friends are smartassesIve learnt to expect it*boops your hand* :oEhhhhhh, it's a lot more complicated, Fiat money is not directly linked to any real physical value, but is tethered to a Reallife system, usually a nation or a conglomerate of nations, so it's value is more based on the faith of people on these nations, which can be kinda stable
Like, the dollar and the Euro are quite stable compared to crypto currency as of nowI dunno why but I like this guyFucking hotIm neitherNo mosaici evolved past the need for sexual intercourseThis is his hidden formYes, however every single business listed in stock markets is overvalued due to the fact they expect a steady business as usual supply of oil, when the reality is very different. When oil production and extraction starts shrinking, and demand keeps going higher, companies will all of a sudden not be able to operate unless they are self sufficient in energy. This will cause a big crash, bigger than the 70s crash as it ain't coming back. For oil to be competitive it will need to at least become cheaper than natural gas which has only happened a few times. 
To make up for the demand in energy, not only to homes but to agricultural and industrial machinery will take at least 5 years, during which many people won't have access to their monocrop (previously tractor and oil powered) food, money to pay for travel, or even fuel for international shipment of goodsThat's even betterWell it's the reason the EU and China and most of the developed countries are pushing for renewable energyThis is not to say oil will not be around, it's just that it will now be considered a depleting energy resource, with limited amounts of it. Nation states will likely use oil as energy reserves in case of war.Also why the Arab nations have been diversifyiong their markets for more than a decadehuhThe technology is not fast enough to make up for the collapse that is coming.OnionsThis guy knows whats upI was just in India for 2 weeks, last week of 2017 and first one of 2018Let's take that as an example.>India

And even in the center everyone is losing faith in their current government's method of operating- even if they're going from "some minor change" to "we got a lot to fix," it's still a radicalization, proving the collective motion of the populace away from the center that I seeSo is trumpHuh, you're just an a few hours northeast of meSame reason trump did

Europe didn't have this, and fell into revolutionary wars between communists and fascists (see Spain, Germany). I'm arguing that the same economic conditions are upcoming, and that the USA does not have the pro-establishment sentiment to not have a civil warEven liberals dont like the establishment- Senate Dems dealing with FCC bullshit

People organize into companies that then create the economy of a nation state. When the crash happens it's not like it will be mad max world.

HmName one example that isn't completely dependent on imported fossil fuel for energy and dependent on Asia for computingToo much patriotism for people to lose faith in my opinionNorthern europeNorthern Europe as in Sweden?And norwayBased on the almost candidacy of Sanders (radicalization of left) and presidency of Trump (radicalization of right), Trump's low approval ratings now that he's becoming viewed as a more establishment figure, and even lower public trust in the DNC, I'm going to have to disagreeAnd scotland, denmark, finland, etcNorway and scotland have very large oil reservesMost EU member states will come out fine I'd guessThe approval ratings are done by the same people who said Clinton would win in a landslide victoryThe UK has political strifeAh yes, Argumentum ad SorosumYou do know that it was 4-1 oddsAs in

But I'm "the" retarded cat.They go to the cities which are usually liberalThat's kinda not how economics workIf your nation is completely dependent on computer systems, and you do not produce any, let me tell you right away that China will not be wasting fuel shipping stuff to Europe once fuels aren't readily availablefile.document=CgADBAADogEAAuhToArEVIhi3EI5IQIAlso they could still go against their methodsthen why have they accurately predicted most elections since 1950?LolSome regions in the EU will be self sufficient, because of Fascist groups that will ariseI knew i had fansN o.

Companies are focused on specific goals, like energy, defense, food, etc. When companies get together and  form a union, they form a Fascist state. The workers of that union are the producers and consumers.Hold upFascism then is the logical outgrowing of capitalism?Despotic/oligarchic =! FascistFascism implies hyperconservatismSup everyoneWhy is ur pfp that thotBEGONE THOTHmm never said they're despotic. Companies have shareholders, usually people that invested in the company and founders, employees that come later on can also get shares of the company through what's called a "vesting" period, but most employees get a salary and benefitsIf jeff bezos or bill gates became head of state, that would absolutely not be fascistSpain exploded into a civil war due to outside influence from German Italy and the sovietsNot really the soviets tbh*europe in general exploded into extremismTheir elected government was far left (as in, syndicalistic)Soviets were trying to influence almost all of Europe at the timeIn many countries the soviets employed spies to put up soviet style communist propagandaNot really, it is the realization that instead of doing what Adam Smith said in wealth of nations where he argued each nation should focus on producing the product in which they're best suited to produce, for example, Germans > cars, Italians > food, which leads to wars as each nation is interconnected, Fascism says each nation should be self sufficient and instead calls for "Cooperative Development" not Globalism.
What kind of markets will evolve in a world of Cooperative Development?

The likely trends would be fewer goods available at higher prices with higher quality.  Durability would be much higher and therefore overall resource consumption would decrease while long term consumer costs would remain the same or decline.

Consumers would also be producers with higher wages and a greater variety of skills.  Hours worked would decline and productivity would increase.  With much lower transportation inputs, energy per unit of consumption would decline.
This tracks better with the consumption reductions we will have to face in the coming decades as well as with the trade disruptions which are inevitable with declining resource bases and a climate which is going dynamic. 

Building broad based national economies with a huge variety of employment and learning possibilities would reverse the trend to inequality present in many societies. It would eliminate the massive instabilities inherent in the huge flows of printed financial instruments through international transfer mechanisms which are plaguing every economy on the planet. All international currency exchange would be done with real goods  the most liquid and saleable being energy and energy certificates.  No printed fiat currencies or debt instruments would cross an international border.  By elimination counterproductive speculation, financial systems of every nation would be able to re-connect with the real productive mechanisms which actually create real wealth.

Cooperative Development goes beyond a simplistic devotion to ever greater economic growth and consumption and deals with the human, environmental and national issues which are fundamental to human progress.Fascism in general is just having an all-powerful government, usually with a capitalist style economic system*Totalitarian capitalismThat's not fascismI literally just described what Fascism is...That's autarkyAlright our group modified it a bit, maybe we can call it ecofascismIts past time to ask some of the questions that often get labeled as non-negotiable or just dont get asked at all:

Why do we group students by age?

Why do schools close for the summer?

Why must the school day start with the rise of the sun?

Why are schools assigned by your address?

Why do students have to go to a school building in the first place?

Why is choice only available to those who can buy their way out? Or buy their way in?

Why cant a student learn at his or her own pace?

Why isnt technology more widely embraced in schools?

Why do we limit what a student can learn based upon the faculty and facilities available?

Why?

merger of corporate and government power" - Benito Mussolini???According to this fascism is meant to put an autocratic government in placeThe Labour Charter of 1927, promulgated by the Grand Council of Fascism, stated in article 7:
"The corporative State considers private initiative, in the field of production, as the most efficient and useful instrument of the Nation," then goes on to say in article 9 that: "State intervention in economic production may take place only where private initiative is lacking or is insufficient, or when are at stakes the political interest of the State. This intervention may take the form of control, encouragement or direct management."So, autarchy=fascismPretty much1. That's debated, unsure how i feel about it
2. Tradition, frankly should go away
3. See above
4. Schools are funded through property taxes
5. Tradition as before, I've seen online classes gain more acceptance
6. Capitalism, baby. 
But in certain areas, wisconsin for one, you can go to any school district in the state provided you can transport yourself there.

Here's a great speech Mussolini gave on autarky when he went to Berlin, highly recommend watching it. He describes how blockades did nothing to their economies as they are self sufficient. Compare that to blockading Venezuela, where they are completely dependent on the outside worldThat's Falangismo, derived from Fascism matehttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacionalsindicalismo...uhmNoThat's like saying socialism is nazismYou just added "radical" to syndicalism as if that changes anything lolSyndicalism isn't falagismIt was rhetorical, it's a quote from the speechIt literally is.

What kinds?What"El nacionalsindicalismo, tambin denominado falangismo, es una teora econmica y poltica nacida en 1931 en Espaa, inspirada en el sindicalismo revolucionario de Sorel, el fascismo y el tradicionalismo y adaptada a las particularidades de la Espaa de la poca."I'm seriously shook rn i have zero idea what you're trying to sayYou can't read Spanish? Just use google translateCeiling fansHold on let me do it for you"National syndicalism" vs. "Syndicalism"I know what it saysYou're just spouting rhetorical nonsense"National syndicalism, also called Falangism, is an economic and political theory born in 1931 in Spain, inspired by Sorel's revolutionary syndicalism, fascism and traditionalism and adapted to the particularities of Spain at the time."I knowI got Logan Paul fans on my ceiling.Syndicalism is older than falangeSo why are you saying Falangismo is not derived from syndicalismCoolYou're saying that it's the other way aroundThat's what I was getting out of this, at leastmmm... no? I said Falangismo is a modified version of sindicalismo and fascismo, adapted to Spain. In any case, my original point is that we need to go beyond individual companies operating inside a nation, with their sole objective being profit. Capitalism is dated, and the next evolution, is cooperative development with national syndicalism as you put itWhy did u steal my ceiling fanNations need to have strong cultures and peoples, we need to stop throwing our heritage down the drainGet back to work, and make great things for our future childrenBecause I wanted it.No
I meant that syndicalism is a form of socialism that doesn't supress innovationThe FaggotryWhy?And before anyone asks: I do not know if the child is dead or not, based on the source.Nobody askedBefore they ask.So the only time you can come up with a form of socialism that doesn't suppress innovation is when corporations are present, proving my point that corporations can be a lot more efficient than direct control by the government and central planningWe don't need to centralize power... we need to decentralize itfile.sticker=CAADAQADRwADUouAEjDMdodwQeIgAgYou
Do know that syndicalism means the abolition of corporations rightIn a sense, yes, and that is somewhat what I am advocating forW

They have a significant portion of their state's populace on their side. Let them get electoral votesIt's good to engage in mainstream political discourse as well thoughThis is especially logical when there's a tiny majority in the house, and no longer are things voted on on a basis of what one actually thinks, but what will get one support from their own party"Oof"

Fine example, papa basedgod washingtonReal change can't happen from within the system because holding control over the system necessitates some degree of conformity to itNot about to go full bernie in here but
He legitimately is a non-corrupt politicianHe could have been king or president for life and just said "fuck no you dummy"*Dabs on* No way grandadBernie Sanders never had a chance before he dropped his revolutionary shtickAnd zerLobbying is the worst corruption on the fucking planetWhat the fuckThe margin of error, is too damn fucking highBut there is nearly no way to change it from outsideYou gotta look at what the lobbies are fighting for, and half the time its shit no person would actually agree to

And yet all our politicians doThere just aren't enough peopleI searched "gender pronouns"Well I mean there's enough guns to do it if you mean like a revolutionAnd i think guerilla warfare is a fantastic example to follow for any revolutionNo.
Not anymore, there's not.The solution is not to add new pronouns but to eliminate gendered pronouns entirely. You can never create a fully inclusive set of pronouns. Singular they is the futureFor a rump state or series of caves that dies after 20 yearsNot to mention guerillas nearly *always* have state fundingThere's about 100 million guns in total (that are at least known, this doesn't even at all account for homebuilt guns whichnare a stupid easy premise depending on what you're building)ouo I'll stick with being a erm..."a cis male with a penis"The sauds for Daesh and the Taliban
Before that the soviets or americansAccelerationism. Promote bad policies to increase discontent and gather more people to your side for the overthrowAnd lets say we pull in all 1 million troops of ours from across the globeA left-wing revolt would have no one.It's folly.Never has it genuinely worked.It just makes everything shittier.And lets not forget the strange weapons caches isis seems to somehow run intoThey're the DaeshTrue enough(Getting into ideas I'm unsure of now btw)What is AccelerationismBut a fresh slate would give really any politics a chance to jumpstartBasically the definition thereOMaking everything worse for everyone so they get pissed enough to do somethingHonk jesus honk if u saves if u love love jesus jesus jesus jesus jesus jesus is the answerThen any form of far left belief system is doomed to fail regardless of if you believe in revolution or reformIt's all about what works in business. Keeping track of all those is too expensive. The only things preventing the widespread adoption of the singular they is a lack of a replacement for Mr./Ms.Also habitEspecially considering the left tends to hate guns in general for...some reasonReform involves changing people's minds.Someone wants some demigod cockDon't confuse liberals and leftists ;PAh, stillI can't tell you how many communists screech at me for being a cis white male with guns lmaoGuns are important for self-defense.
I do think some sort of registry would reduce crime (authoritarian, yes, but maybe neccesary)Nah you're valid no matter whatEven though they're usually just liberals who don't understand why guns are a genuinely important thing for a civilian populous to havethey or them implies more than one personAs a trans communist girl, you're coolDon't youSelf defense, keeping government from getting too ridiculous (even though nobody likes to draw a line besides "when they try to take my guns" even though the governments been chipping away at that right for 80 years now)I kneel for no one nUsing it for a singular person when you don't know the gender is fairly common already. It has been documented back at least to the 19th centuryOr shooting at that robber in your houseThat's debatable imo 
But more a question of tactics and safety than gun controlGovernment is the main reason the 2nd amendment exists, and people somehow misconstrue this with hunting (even in the gun community we have these people)I knowDepends on what they're stealing honestlyDont yell at meOh wait my badYa ya i'm being pedantivYa ya i'm being pedantixHiYa ya i'm being pedantic*the 14th centuryIf its my life hell noIf its my life hell noWhat if people start calling other people sexist for referring to them as they?If they're stealing my TV or trying to get my guns then yeah, they likely are just gonna rob the next guy too.

If they're stealing food they can take it, along with an invitation to my home any time they're in needThen they can fuck right offI wish we could just have he or she again...XD you got sassHug?If they seem to be a threat or just stealing to support a life of crime then yeah they kinda did it to themselves at that pointAww fuck this is horribleI would say they are GheyIf it's some asshole trying to take your TV chances are they'll just run if they see you lolIt's the direction society is moving already and we're not going to make exceptions for a few people that war to be called zhe or whateverYepThe guide is set up for people to fuck up I swearBut it's good to be safeInvader fucking zimExactly, like if they are armed tooI KNOW XDMy concern then is "what of my neighbor who owns no guns? Will they just be robbed blind? Will they have the insurance to get it replaced?"ZhateverI mean seriously, "per" is used fucking twiceYeah
They took out the "form militias" part but that's one of the most important parts imoI heard an amazing show?I fucking know rightExactlyAgain i have aspergersAnd now most militias are FBI honeypotsStill Id rather not have some stranger in my private abodeHaha, yeah...

:(I dont give a fuck if im playing the aspie card too often, i can because social situations are really hard enough for people like me. So we dont need a clusterfuck of gender pronouns to make them harder.Whoa you can't say aspiefile.sticker=CAADBAADRgEAAvHAlAl0MrpD1XzTyAIfile.sticker=CAADAQADBQADidMvEG42w4Z0W2vQAgI'll stick to he and sheThis to an extent. If they did it because they need food or water, go ahead. If they need money they can get the fuck out, likely in a body bag.Man the police really suck a lot of the timeTbhI'm counting the FBI as police:PThere are better ways of asking for foodAnd it sucks that all police get the same rep from a bunch of assholes who simply wear the same outfitthey is a pronoun too, singularTrue enoughZingularSecret policeThey are basicallySetting up soup kitchens and intervention programs Honestly, if they come to my door and ask, Id give them shit I dont eat, just to clear my houseJust cops that you don't hear about so michThe real antifaTbqh they can take all my canned goods and plastic silverwarewhy did nobody think of theyHeating they'll have to figure outBut it'll be enough to sustain themLmaoBecause they is dumb as hellTrue enoughits?? not??Yeah.
There are genuine community police initiatives and shit that are genuinely good for everyone

But then another six year old gets flashbanged by a bunch of cowboys with riotsuits and we're back to square one on community relationsI think this gender fluid trash creates problem even for trans people since many people could go and bash them for it. Even though they don't create these issues even though their situation is tougher..u. all I'm saying, is that if you appear to be male or female, don't get mad at me if I call you by what you appear to be...ExactlyYeah.

blood and my blood pressure wasn't high enough to pump it out :/Well thendoes australia have a MSM ban?men who have sex with menBleh x.x Im on beta blockersis this not common knowledge?I'm trying to get gay donors to be allowed to donate blood here when blood is ALREADY routinely tested for HIVand people don't know about this?Ive heard about it before ayehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men_blood_donor_controversyI didn't but I like informationaustralia has a 1 year deferral just like the united statesThanks for the linkI'm in the mood for a bondIm in the mood for a sleep but I cantsome countries, especially progressive northern european countries, just have lifetime deferrals if you sucked another dude's dickdespite the fact that it's protocol for blood to be tested for hivfile.document=BQADAQADPQADrVUBR1VEzB9KihVAAgIt's scary how much pain can slow a person downDamnMy legs feel like they are going to give ouyWhat happened?I feel a muscle twitching like a worm directly behind my kneeWork, school, collegeDamnI'm on my feet almost all the timehttp://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2010/06/inferior_blood.htmlThis has happened to meIf you have the HIV virus in your system it does not show up on tests until months after the initial exposure, that's why the 12 month suspension is in place, so that if you unknowingly have the virus in your system and you donate, at least it will show up on blood work.Otherwise, within the 12 months, testing for the virus will not detect it.true but then in that case with how high the rates of hiv are among blacks, that should make having sex with another black person a deferralIn that case shouldnt anyone whos had sex within the past 12 months not give blood?How does the percentage compare to the percentage that MSM men have it in the US?It's singling out a high risk group, and men especially are more likely to contract the virus than women are.Uh, isnt anyone who has unprotected sex with someone who has it most likely gonna get itI think that's a mythLmfao, but statistics back the claim uphttps://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/racialethnic/africanamericans/index.html
https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/msm/index.htmlIt's a balancing act of when to defer people because otherwise the qualifications can be too stringent and then a large number of people won't be able to donate. It's all about hitting high risk groups and people that are sexual partners of them, women are also disallowed from donating for 12 months after having sex with an MSM man.Again, they're hitting the top risk group, not so much focusing on the second group, blacks, because, as your source stated, more than half, 58% were gay or bisexual men, whom are part of the first group, so if they deal with the risk associated with homosexuals they're already hitting more than half of the second group.FoodGod that looks scrumptiousIt wasThe culinary team is doing pretty goodWhat exactly is it though?GAS GAS GASSpankedfursDon't likeA large majority of furries like spanking?Rosemary crackers with tomato vinageret on top and the sauce is balsamic vinager honey reductionI thinkis that supposed to be a dessert?AppetizerFor someone with a tiny stomachIt's a starter to a bigger mealgoodBetter be, or elsefile.document=CgADAQADIwADZOt5Rk9asddhMulEAgOh.I think that falls under human nsfw.Also you're all so qUIETAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaa?file.document=CgADBAADJaYAAnoXZAeW6tvUigLyywIBeautifulfile.document=CgADBAADWaIAArsdZAcD2HgC9i0smAII'm gay and that's okfile.document=CgADBAADbwMAAiscZAfULcnk2HeW-AIfile.document=CgADBAADjwIAAtsj-VKMzrofzK0iNgIDeal with it.file.document=CgADBAADHaAAAigdZAfxCsWFneJKIgIhttps://youtu.be/VdxXHsQsDaAit's. here.it's. fucking. here.THE CUBIC CHUNKS MOD.holy. fuck.I think I just had a mindgasmI don't think you like star warsClone wars was amazing, if lacking scale which was disappointingNo you don't like itI like you*boops you all**sneezes*I hate summer...Same.

Words alone can both harm and heal, especially when those words hold some significance and relevance to someone.

However, if you add a picture with those words, you are giving people a visual to re-enforce the meaning of the words.

And if someone doesn't get the reference, they have a search engine to learn what it is.You done it. Religious waaaaar!https://clips.twitch.tv/ConfidentCreativeGaurCorgiDerpThe magic of memes slip away when you apply logic :3No. In afterlife we will be in one massive yiff ;~;Sounds like a lonely masturbation sessionWow.

You're just countering an argument nobody is really making and imagining an enemy to white people. And believing white people to be under attack is the first stepping stone of nearly all racist views. Not that the phrase is itself racist- just that it has strong connotations and associations with racist ideasSo saying "it's ok to be white" isn't racist, but it associates you with racistsYoure white, you are the problem
-random protester girl during berkley protests.Idk I usually stay out of idpol because the side I'm morally inclined to defend is opposed directly to the one with an abundance of the simple Google-able statistics necessary for online debateShe represents a minority(As in her beliefs are rare, not as in she's not white :P)Or the people who shout black lives matter, but yell at you if you say everyones lives matter.I dont understand why people do thisShouldnt all lives matter in the first place?Or am I missing the argumentYep, but people nowadays will yell at you if you say itBut whats the argument against it?Its a counter protest to our black lives matter protestsThe argument seems to be just to point out that the black lives matter movement is saying something obvious, i.e. that "black lives matter." But the point of the movement isn't just to say something obvious for the sake of saying it. The point is to say something obvious in order to point out the obvious injustices of our policing institution in America, and more broadly the entire judicial system. And so by saying "all lives matter," you are turning the message of the movement into a color blind message, which it inherently cannot and should not be. Now, there is something to be said of police brutality in general, whether against black people or white people or asian people or Native Americans, or whoever else. But black lives matter is specifically in response to the racial prejudice present in our police force, and there is a lot to be said about that too.I seeYour statistically more likely to die during arrest if you are whiteBut thats 2012Do you think its changed much in a few yearsIdkI tell meNo,  it reallyNo, it reallyNo, not reallyYes, but that's explained by the fact that you are statistically more likely to be white in the first place. Again, there is something to be said of police brutality against all races, but when we're talking about prejudice in the police force, we have to look at the relative likelihoods of being killed by a police given you being some given race, and the likelihood that you would be apart of that race in the first place. So for white people, there is no negative prejudice judging by these statistics because they make up 63% of the population but only 51% of police murders. On the other hand, black people make up only 13% of the total population, but make up 31% of total police murders, which is a strong indication of prejudice.Yes, but that's explained by the fact that you are statistically more likely to be white in the first place.

They agree with you, they just think your objections are irrelevant and distract from the real issuesWoops already been responded tooThat's not what the statistics say. The stats say more white people are killed. It's not given as a percentage of total arrests for that racial category, so you can't say anything about the probabilities of if a white person or black person is more likely to be shot during arrestAccording to crime statistics you are more likely to be killed by a cop if you are white. I dont see how police brutality is only a black problemLmao hes writing essays better than I doThat's not what that statistic you sent says*Killed by a cop while committing a crimeStillDepends on the crime really^"13% of police murders are black" vs "13% of black arrests end in murders" are two very different statistics, and you misrepresented the first as the secondThe police are people tooSaying they cant protect themselves is basically saying that since they serve the public they cant have rightsWhat even are lawyers?

Answer:
"Because Nazis are very real today and are actively trying to harm people of minority groups whether physically, mentally, or emotionally. Therefore, jokes about people that are actively trying to harm someone because they are who they are will not be taken like an actual joke. And making jokes about being Jewish is potentially offensive to those who are actually Jewish, like when you make a joke about a Christian or any other religion that generalizes them and insults them."Holy shit, you got a triggered bitchIkr!Like faaaarkI love the nazis are very real today like wtf bitchall you need to do is look at one of the /pol/ meetup photos and then you can never really take any of it seriously againBehold the master racePolitically incorrectTho the fifa vids of reddit are funnyalso I love how many of them have black hair, and are therefore, not the pure Aryan raceFun Fact: Hitler wasn't eitherNini uwuFun fact: Hitler was buff asHitler killed the jews, gays, and disabled because he had a shit fetish he was embarrassed ofNight night, sleep tight, don't let the furfags biteohWas it grapefarts>Was it grapefarts?Worse.

Wolves would keep menageries of foxes in their dens, using them for recreational copulation during non-mating season for the females. In turn foxes evolved to complement this symbiotic relationship by evolving a 100% efficient metabolism and the capability to survive entirely on nutrients absorbed from wolf semen. 

Over millions of years, these foxes evolved special pores beneath their fur that allowed them to consume cum through the skin. This works best when the semen is rubbed into them by rolling around in an orgy of wolves and other foxes, leading to their instinctive promiscuity. The anus of the fox is a peculiar structure indeed. Without the need for a full digestive track, the vestigial lower intestine became a somewhat shorter section of highly elastic polymer, extracted from the long protein chains found in wolf semen. This allows the colon of the fox to expand in size by a factor of ten while maintaining its tightness and shape. The colon and what remains of the large intestine are still connected to the small intestine in modern foxes but rather than being the end of the digestive tract it acts as a secondary mouth. The large intestine feeds backwards into the small intestine where semen is readily digested without needing to be processed by the stomach.

Like the primary mouth, the lower end of the foxes digestive track has salival glands, though with a different purpose. The anal salival glands of the fox are for lubrication and cleaning out of the colon. This also aids in the conveyance of semen into the small bowel. The modern anthropomorphic fox maintains this symbiotic relationship with wolves to this very day. It is this phenomenon to which we all owe the sexual utility of the fox.Nibba, what are you smoking, there is no official furry loreWHAT IS THIS ABOVEWell, there is someHOW YOU EXPLAIN THATHUH?Oh yes, though there is another term for it.

Or it's to form a distinct community with a strong sense of belonging in a society which has outcast them (economically)

Wealth is the alienation of the self. So poverty and alienation are pretty much oppositesOther reasons about a person can drive them to crime also, but I would be here for hours explaining all of themClass of poor people and outcastsFar more likely to be victims and perps of crimeIncluded in my pointFar more likely to join gangsButton guy meme

*sweaty Danny dorito*Statistics boiI dont think he ever thought thatThe effects of institutionalized racism and ostracism coupled with poverty on a group of people really does force them into crimeNot all poor people are selfish assholes that would rather steal others property than work their way uphttps://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=5137I second thisThey're genetically, visually, everything, the same as other japanese people
But their great-great-great grandparents were prostitutes so they're fuckedSo, poor people are assholesNo.
Their material conditions force them to do nasty things.+1If you were in that situation, you would too.Or they live on the street or homeless shelters for the rest of their daysThey deal with what they gotWhen I was like 5 we were so poor we had to gather to gather loose change in the couch to be able to buy milk, does that mean we turned to crime? No! My dad starting working 2 jobs and went back to college to switch degreesBut if you noticeWe were poorAnd we didnt turn to crimeIve never committed a crime and my family makes 30000 a yearI dont know your situation but exactlyI'm not talking situationally poor, hun
I mean in poverty systematicallyI was in that situation too
Had to sell off my gameboy and games for food money at one point Thats itI'm out of the online roomI'm in global gourmet nowUmmYay?Good for you I guessThis sounds a lot more condescending than i intended
Meant it in a sympathetic wayLike, if your parents and their parents and their parents all lived in a dead-end neighborhood with no other opportunitiesThe only way to protect your family in some of these areas is to form protection rackets.
And from there, gangs.I think the argument we should be having is over the difference between institutional factors and situational onesWe've had this same disagreement/misunderstanding over individual material conditions vs institutional causes- for instance we got here from a discussion of whether white privilege exists, based on median income statistics placing whites as the poorestI think it would be a good thing, Lucy, for you to clear up what you mean by institutional poverty/racism/etc and for us to talk about that a bitWouldnt you consider the fact my family is 80k in debt as the system working against ysI think we should work on improving the police in the short term with training and greater accountability, then we can safely beef up policing in the inner cities to crack down on the gangs and make those areas safe enough for economic development. The long-term result is reduced unemployment, which leads to reduced poverty, which in turn makes the community stronger and safer. I think this plan, possibly with some minor variations, is something most people can agree to.basically
institional poverty means systems that keep those in poverty from advancing anywhereWhich the USA is notinstitutional racism is a lot more nuanced and i've actually forgotten the precise definition fuck hold onI wish.Sure, from a governmental perspectiveIf you try hard enough you can and will get out of povertywe have things like welfare etc
but when you really get into it
things like education costing exorbiant amounts
requiring loads of education to get anywhere
housing prices
city living being so fucking expensivealright.
I'll acede that if you work long and hard, for decades, you can pull out of poverty.
But then they've just gotten to where everyone else was at the start.You don't need a college education to be successfulHow the fuck is that okY'all talk aboutoopsAlso this thing called the stock markety'all talk about upward mobility and how taxing the rich will make it disheartening to the poor
as if they're not already fucking nihilistic over the fact that if they work for their whole lives the best thing they'll have is being able to pay bills on timethat'that's gamblingPenny stocks are cheap and will almost always give you a profitgambling is not a valid means of measuring success.What's wrong with gamblingnothing.
but literal luck-based money-making is not valid to upward mobilityBut if you are in dire need of money you can always invest in penny stocks and make moneyyeah
because gambling is such a great strategy for the poorIf you don't have an addictive personality then its a good ideaIf you seem to have the starts to a gambling addiction someone close to you will notice and rehab will likely end it, like most addictionsTheir are specific rehab centers just for gambling addictionThere are specific rehab centers just for gambling addictionYou can't argue you have a upward socioeconimical mobility thanks to gambling
It's the opposite of real mobility, it's borderline luck-based and it is only possible if you have a starting capital big enough to make your investment worth
This is often not the case, expecially in extreme poverty ridden cases or in cases in which you don't have access to the knowledge and means necessary to start to "earn" money with your luckoh yeah and they probably are either free or penny stock cheap*sad trombone*You have been selected for the following question:

No wonder I'm irritatedWhy else would Blaire white have so much supportThe way I see it sjws are a bait, practically begging for outsiders to despise feminism as a whole and everything siws support because of themAnd as much as I despise them I despise the anti-sjw rational skeptics more because they took that bait and drew more people to itAlso there's more of themBut, people dont see it as feminism as a wholeThey are anti-sjw not anti-feminist.I very much disagree. There's a definite perception in common society, amplified in the antisjw circle, that feminists are whiny white girls who don't know how good they have it and hate menSjws are a cancer to feminismI agree with thisI think our main disagreement is where we draw the line between feminist and sjwI draw the line at anything past classical egalitarianismAka every human created equal no matter what gender, race etc... they areThus everyone be treated as equalIf you instantly blame men or white people in general for pretty much anything you're in sjw territory
This includes "men are trash" and other broad insults against individuals at the top of institutional discrimination
If you genuinely mean all men individually are bad or worse simply because they are men then you got problems
This is bad
Other than that you good
Literally anything else: nonbinary genders, veganism, anticiv, yaddayadda no sjw
And if you blame institutional oppression for racial or gender issues that's fine too
Yell at institutions, not people. This is the difference between feminism and sjwI think the line should be when you start becoming a female supremistI win gay contestTho very cyuuuute~Do you get a lot of weird looks from people?oofDegenerate homosexual>wearing a tail without a headPlease stopCease your faggotryWith a fursuit head on you're anonymous at leastAbscond with your homosexual deviancyfile.sticker=CAADBAADbQMAAnZcLgABrm3evD4Q-VcCI bet that tail reeks on nutI bet that tail reeks of nutAnd of shameAnd now i hunt the gays and bring them to justiceYou named your bed Justice?No!

"The food stores are running low" is a lot less violent-criminal-act-causing than "there's lots of food but you can't afford it"Trade with the outsideBut in the current and likely to continue for a long time worldwide political climate no one would want to trade with a commune that can't self sustainTrad being a requirement makes it non self sustainingTrade being a requirement makes it non self sustainingLuckily it's not about worldwide political climates, it's about getting the resources you need. Even if that's from trading with local farmers and crapNothing is self sustainingWhy is self sustaining even a restriction you're placing on my communeMaybe trade with another commune that had more luck with natural resourcesOtherwise I don't think it would last longOr trade with the capitalist world outside:PNo one would want to trade unless you had natural resources to offer. There aren't many natural resources in ghettos"Hey I have eggs can I get some capitalist money"
"Sure, we will buy your eggs for capitalist money"
"Hey, I have capitalist money, can I have phones"
"Yes, decent businesses sell things at agreed upon prices regardless of whether or not the source is self sustaining, that will be five lumps of capitalist money"Capitalists would trade for things they neededFactory jobsYou can't sell the workers for resourcesIt wouldn't even have to produce anything of its own actually. Just everyone working their jobs on the outside and pooling the earnings is already anarchistHeck not even necessarily pooling earnings, just using it to help each otherAlso, a major part of trade is that people mainly do it with those who share similar ideals, why would a capitalist want to trade with a commune.*trade to further political causeWhat if some of the people don't want to participateYou can't stop emOk then they're not part of the communeSo, do what we say or your outWhat if someone wants to be an artist but also lives with one of the factory workersWhat noOk1. You can contribute in whatever way you can
2. You can be located geographically near other members of the commune- even in the same house- without participating financiallyThen what's the point in it if not everyone participatesThen its just practically a social club.What's the point of making a democratic nation if not everyone benefits from democracy?You're using principles that you believe are better to better your own conditions. Those are both endgoals in and of themselvesIf you try hard enough anyone can get their way in democracyNot the people who aren't in the democracyJust like how the people who aren't in the commune don't get the benefits of the communeWhy would you benefit if you choose not to participateExactly what I'm sayingNot the same at allYes it is??>Being in a commune and getting kicked out because of laziness
>not participating in democracyNot the sameYou don't get "kicked out" at all boiWhen did I say thatFine, remove the word kickedI never said anything about forcing anyone in or out of the communePlease tell me where you think I said people who don't contribute shouldn't be members so I can clear up this misunderstanding>not part anymore, meaning they are outOk then they're not part of the communeIf you don't want to participate then you don't have to be part of the communeNot participating=not part=outNo one would want to trade unless you had natural resources to offer. There aren't many natural resources in ghettosFactory jobsWhat if some of the people don't want to participateYou can't stop emOk then they're not part of the communeB-b-but why not? ;-;What about me?

I like anthros that wear pants in public.*snaps and suddenly no clothes but with the kid friendly ken doll anatomy**snaps fingers and suddenly no clothes but with the kid friendly ken doll anatomy*My whole problem with it is that I like to see me as my fursona. My fursona is literally modeled after myself, but just as a snow leopard.The only thing keeping me from pushing into otherkin territory is that I don't believe I was born in the wrong body. I do believe however that if past lives exist, I may have been a snow leopard at one point, but I am not spiritual enough to 100% believe it.Im a transhumanistTechnology save me from eternal oblivionMe toofile.sticker=CAADAQAD4wQAAmE8yAdHonF3_GbprwISameIs it because you feel morally obligated?I just don't like feralsAnd taurs are qtIdk how being morally obligated is a bad thing.What you may be referring to is socially obligated416% noI saw a 6 and a 4 and thought "oh 3/5 people like your city!" nopeNo, I mean morally, as animals should not be fucked.I dont think animals should be fuckedMore people think he is a bad mayor than people that existThere's this interesting way that anti bestianity laws are written and enforced in some places, where it's the penetration that's forbidden.I miss when New Jersey had it 100% legal. Then I could do it no problem.Whats this gameLooks like simcity?SimCity for the SNESYet you are against taurs XDI don't like taurs, I do like ferals. Taurs are cheating in my book.Dont even say nuthin to me boi u look like a mufukinuuuuuuuuuuuhI called that shit, haha.

Go see things like the Brain in a Jar thought experiment or directly go to cogito ergo sum and KantIt's your brain actually, colors of different luminosity are processed at different rates by your visual cortex, creating various different illusion much like this onethats not equality, which is what feminists wantTrans? You guessed itThey have a fucking comic con at Wooster and we could show up in fursuits and piss everyone offoh cool I can help get tax breaks for being gay :Dthey got colossalcon in sandusky which is like, 3x the size of anthroconR.I.P true equalityand zipcon which is in akron universityWooster has a little mini con thing they set up every yearP much but its the thought that gay people are discriminated in the work place which may be true but you cant push social change through legislationYeah it's an attempt to be fair not equal. I'm okay with that but it's probably been taken way too far herelife isnt fairtoo bad if youre a faggot tbhThey want equal result not equal oppertunityThey want equal result not equal opportunityI hate that mindset, even as an autistic gay manI'm fine with it personally. If ya need help to be as effective in the workforce as everyone else why not give it? Of course that's not what the tax breaks we were talking about are aiming for thoughThis calzone is deliciousi just wish gays couldnt get married tbhI like equal opportunity, most skilled workers should be paid most, throw all the other politics outid rather they have a civil union with the same legal rights as a marriage, just with a different narid rather they have a civil union with the same legal rights as a marriage, just with a different nameFair enough, everyone has their opinion and they're both valid methods imo. This is just the one I personally favorGayridgeyusSeparate but equal hasn't worked beforeI mean, heres my thought, tax breaks for hiring specific people in washington used to have merit, like tax breaks for hiring disabled people or felons, but last time i checked you get bigger tax breaks for hiring gays, women, and trans people. Does that mean the sjw's think we are worse off than disabled people shit u rightimma call the sjw's homophobico shit nibbaDoitThis guy gets ityou know what?they sound patronizingCuz they areor rather I think the word is condescendingthe left sounds godawfully condescendingi know this is a meme but its trueit's transphobic for people to be trans cuz they're adhering to a different genderAnyway, politics tend to be polarizing, heres some gifs of cute aminalsfile.document=CgADBAADwRMAAuoYZAd0tVB8PSznHwIfile.document=CgADAQADIgADeIigRkphFVtcvUCTAgfile.document=CgADBAAD3wcAAicaZAdVqSBWeoCMwgIReminds me of fat kidsCute drgnfile.sticker=CAADBQADTgADOQWkBs8R-WMcCqSAAggays should not have equal protection under the lawwatwhy should we make legislature based off the 3% of the population that chooses to be with guys cuz they cant get a gfNiggaWut, that isn't why people are gayfile.sticker=CAADAQAD4zsAAq8ZYgcoTtRHCaxo3AIIm gay because i suck dick more than i suck on popsiclesnigga are you stupidforgot, its cuz of a biological defectsorryAre you a trollnibba are you retardedsameGuys help im having heart palpatations cuz i never knew straight furries existed, let alone homophobic ones.>assuming Im straightfile.sticker=CAADAQADVAADQWb7DXSH-Og9BDy9AgIve heard this argument, but even if you are right i wouldnt care, i like dudes how does that change how i navigate life?Honestly how about protect all groups of people, dont give preferential treatment, and let himans be humansAint that hardbecause its going against natureHe's in another group with me and I can tell you the answer is yeswhich groupFuckin' Christ man, nature is fucking dumbi thought you were gayEh, plenty of things that we do as humans go against naturei amohtell that to NigeriaSergalchat dumbassyoure in that one?Oh im in a sergal chat but not one you are inId rather not, they think all gays "eat da poopoo"/R/SERGALCHAThelp me find a sergal bf thenXDthey doNo you're worst foxAre you being for realthat was one Nigerian priest, but nice way to generalizeNo that's UgandaI dont think you're being for realjust like that priest :^)*UgandanTHIS WAS UGANDA>Generalizing
